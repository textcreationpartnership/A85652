         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS Precepts direct, ſo Examples encourage, obedience: and the latter, upon moſt men, have much more effect, than the former.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Francis</hi> had by <hi>Lucretia</hi> four Children; two Daughters <hi>Katharine</hi> and <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> and two Sons, <hi>Anthony,</hi> that dyed an infant, and <hi>Philip;</hi> who was of a pregnant wit, an affable diſpoſition, handſome features of body and and a ſtrange ſweetneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; furniſhed with all the excellencies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thoſe, who from Heaven are deſigned unto the good of Souls, are uſually beautified.</p>
                        <p>His vertuous <hi>Parents</hi> vertuouſly educated him whilſt yet a child: firſt entring him time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                              <hi>What is Writ concerning his Childhood is from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Siſter, of his own mouth, of</hi> Ludovico Parigi <hi>his moſt ancient and familiar freind.</hi>
                           </note> into <hi>Grammar,</hi> wherein he not only outwent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo admired by his <hi>School-fellows.</hi> He ſtudied <hi>Rethorick</hi> too under an able <hi>Maſter,</hi> through whoſe diſcipline he proved a good proficient.</p>
                        <p>Among other eſſays of his after-piety, which at times from his very infancy he diſcovered to the world, a marvellous inclination to things divine, a rare modeſty, and very great reverence to his <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> were remarkable in him. He was ſo dutifull to his <hi>Father,</hi> that, but once in all his life, was he known to move him (in the leaſt) to anger; viz. when he very lightly ſtrook his <hi>Siſter Katharine,</hi> as ſhee diſturbed him at his prayers: which fault (if at thoſe years it may be termed a fault) being reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by him, he a long while after bewailed.</p>
                        <p>His <hi>Mothers</hi> commands he was ſo carefull of, that being at any time bid to ſtay any where, he would not ſtir from the place without her leave. She dying,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114712:11"/> and his <hi>Father</hi> marrying anew, his <hi>Step-Mother,</hi> out of a reverence to his Sanctity, loved him entirely, as her own; and when he afterward left <hi>Florence,</hi> wept ſore to part with him. Yea in her laſt moſt deſperate Sickneſs, being at the point of Death, ſhe oft redoubled his <hi>name,</hi> ever and anon calling him thereby, as if the very mentioning of it were a kinde of eaſe to her.</p>
                        <p>Nor only was he thus reſpective to his <hi>Parents</hi> and betters; even his equals and inferiours found him ſo pleaſant, as if he had no mixture of Choller in him at all: ſo that for his excellent temper, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent carriage he was (by contraction of his name) ſtyled <hi>Pippus bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>By which amiableneſs both of Nature, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he not only deſerved the love of men, but was protected by God, even to a <hi>miracle:</hi> For being ſome eight or nine years old, and (as boys are) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of riding, he got up on an aſſe that was in an outer court; and on a ſudden together with the <hi>aſſe</hi> fell down a pair of ſtairs into a <hi>cellar,</hi> where a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preſently running took him up ſound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well, whom ſhe ſuppoſed to have been bruiſed to pieces.</p>
                        <p>Theſe rare accompliſhments of the minde were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſpeciall care of religion, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: and his devotions argued in him a ſtrange maturity, and carried with them much of authority.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114712:12"/> procured him already that favour with <hi>God</hi> that whatever he requeſted of our <hi>Lord,</hi> he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained: So that it oft hapned, when he had loſt any thing upon recourſe to his <hi>prayers</hi> he preſently found it.</p>
                        <p>He drew his firſt breathings of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Fryers predicant,</hi> whoſe Church dedicated to S. <hi>Mark,</hi> he much frequented, inſomuch as living afterward in <hi>Rome,</hi> when any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of that <hi>Order</hi> viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he would uſually ſay; <hi>Whatever good I have by</hi> Gods <hi>bleſſing received from my Infancy: I owe it all to the</hi> Fathers <hi>of your Society; principally to</hi> Zenobius <hi>de</hi> Medices, <hi>and</hi> Servantius Minius: of whom he was wont to relate this paſſage.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two had agreed together, every night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to <hi>Mattens,</hi> to confeſſe their ſins to one another, but the enemy of mankind envying them ſo great a good, knocks at <hi>Zenobius's</hi> chamber one night, <hi>two hours</hi> before ordinary, and cries, <hi>O ho, riſe,</hi> 'tis high time: whereat he awaks, and leaping out of bed hies him to Church, where he finds the counterfeit <hi>Servantius</hi> walking hard by the ſeat of <hi>Confeſſion. Zenobius</hi> taking him for <hi>Servantius</hi> indeed devoutly kneels to make his <hi>confeſſion,</hi> the <hi>devill</hi> ſits by, takes it, and at any fault the <hi>Penitent</hi> confeſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Piſh, this is nothing, no fault, this:</hi> then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſome worſe offence, ſtill he replyed, Theſe <hi>are but trifles.

                        <p>Beſides theſe he reſorted to an eminent <hi>Preacher</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> called <hi>Baldoline,</hi> whom he greatly delighted to hear; of whoſe Sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The <hi>Holy Youth</hi> thus taken up with Spirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, this divine priviledge was granted him, that burning with the love of all vertues he even flamed with a <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>ſuffering</hi> for Chriſt.

                        <p>No leſs bravery of minde did he expreſs, when his <hi>Fathers</hi> houſe being on fire, he bare with ſuch moderation the loſs of no ſmall quantity of goods; that he thereby raiſed in all a very great opinion of his future piety.</p>

                        <p>At his entrance into the City, he met with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity (to his own wiſh) of devoting himſelf to Chriſt: for going to one <hi>Galeottus Caccius</hi> a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> whom poſſibly he formerly knew, he ſeeing the modeſty of the <hi>youth,</hi> took him into his houſe, and pittying his neceſſity, allotted him a little chamber, allowing him yearly a quantity of <hi>Corn,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> gave to a <hi>Baker,</hi> to whom he repaired daily for a <hi>loaf</hi> to ſuſtain life with.</p>

                        <p>A little before <hi>Witſuntide,</hi> a feſtivity dedicated to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to whom <hi>Philip</hi> having long ſince piouſly ſurrendred up himſelf, now more intenſely pray'd; <hi>Lo!</hi> on an inſtant he perceived himſelf ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a paſſionate fervour of Divine Love, that flinging himſelf on the earth, like one in a <hi>ſwoon</hi> gaſping for air, he was forced immediately to <hi>bare</hi> his <hi>breſt:</hi> when, the extream heat ſomewhat allayed, he roſe, and tranſported with extraordinary joy, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his right hand to his left ſide, found a kind of <hi>riſing</hi> where the heart is &amp; ſeated, ſwollen to the bigneſs of ones <hi>fiſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What the cauſe of this <hi>tumor</hi> was, plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he was dead, in the view of divers: for as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114712:16"/> the <hi>Surgeon</hi> opened his <hi>Corpſe</hi> before skilful <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> that were by; they found <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>five leſſer,</hi> which they call the <hi>ſhort, ribs,</hi> broken clean aſunder, and ſticking forth like a bow, which for <hi>fifty</hi> years afterward that he lived, at no time ever cloſed again: and yet (which ſeems incredible) he never found from it, either then, or afterward, the leaſt pain or trouble.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time, though he were in very good temper of body, and perfectly free from any grief or paſſion, yet was he ſuddenly taken with a <hi>palpitation</hi> of the heart, that held him from that moment to his laſt breath: Yet it uſed to ſeize on him only when he was converſant in matters of Religion; as when he ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> gave <hi>Abſolution,</hi> miniſtred the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> prayed, or performed the like offices; at which his heart would ſo leap within him, as though it would have broke its priſon, and have forced its way through him. Then ſhould you have ſeen the <hi>ſtools, bed,</hi> and the <hi>chamber</hi> it ſelf ſhaken and toſſed, as with an <hi>earth-</hi>quake; ſo once at the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of S. <hi>Peter</hi> when kneeling down upon a great and heavy board, his whole body did ſo quake and tremble, that the board he reſted on moved up and down, like a thing of no weight at all. From that time was <hi>Philip</hi> ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted unto the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that after he was Prieſt, he would every day (except the rites of the Church were againſt it) uſe that prayer in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs; Deus cui omne cor patet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it was likewiſe, that if any <hi>Penitent</hi> coming to <hi>Confeſſion</hi> chanced to lean againſt his breaſt, he ſhould (even to admiration) feel that throbbing of his heart, and, if his head touched him, ſometimes perceive it recoil, as if ſtruck with a hammer; and he in the mean while freed of all Temptations.

He being by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> means incenſed with a Zeal to the ſervice of God repaired to a Prieſt, for abſolution of his ſins, who repulſed him, for that he refuſed to abjure committing the ſame again, he, coming to <hi>Philip</hi> ſomething ſad, relates what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beſeeching him to pray to God for him, though moſt unworthy. <hi>Philip</hi> chearing his deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minde, and making light of the difficulties ſaid Go: <hi>I am now haſting to pray for you; and will not deſiſt till I have moved the</hi> moſt High <hi>to pitty:</hi> and ſo he did: for ſhortly after, upon his withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next occaſions to thoſe ſins, he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved according to his deſires by the ſame <hi>Priest,</hi> who had formerly rejected him; and became a great obſerver of <hi>Philip</hi> ever after.</p>
                        <p>And here muſt not be forgot, that when he was <hi>young,</hi> being very handſome, he was by ſome debauched perſons inticed to villany as he came from Sermon; but he immediately diſcourſed to them <hi>ex tempore</hi> of the <hi>uglineſs</hi> of <hi>vice,</hi> and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>vertue,</hi> with ſuch courage, that they went away his <hi>converts,</hi> who came to <hi>pervert him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He drave divers to ſeverall <hi>Religious Orders.</hi> Whereupon <hi>S. Ignatius Loiola</hi> Founder of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> living then at <hi>Rome,</hi> uſed to call him the <hi>Saints-bell</hi> of that time; for that he excited others to <hi>Regular</hi> Diſcipline, while himſelf led a <hi>Secular</hi> life: juſt as the <hi>Bell</hi> that tolls others to Church, and it ſelf the while abides in the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was deſirous to have made him his own, but God had otherwiſe appointed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philips</hi> Sons obſerved, that thoſe who deſpiſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114712:19"/> his counſel for the moſt part came to an ill end. So it chanced to one that profeſſed <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> had chid for ſome heinous fact, but he ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his admonition; and no ſooner went from the place, but was unfortunately murdred. The like hapned to another, whom once, or twice he had wiſhed to repent, who growing obſtinate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes was impriſoned, convicted of a notorious crime, and adjudged to dye, but at the earneſt ſuit of his friends was condemned to the <hi>Gallies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet whilſt imployed in the <hi>cure</hi> of Souls, he neglects not other acts of piety, he oft viſited <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> where with his own hands he made beds, cleanſed away all filth, ſwept the floor, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in meat, and did ſuch like offices; but in the firſt place commended to God the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>dying</hi> people; not leaving them till they either recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or died.</p>
                        <p>Theſe inſtances of <hi>Chriſtian charity</hi> ſo inflamed the hearts of many unto Piety, that not only the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but even the <hi>Laity,</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> began to frequent <hi>Infirmities</hi> and places of charity (a thing not common in that age) where, as every one ſtood affected they releived the fick, or ſtrangers and pilgrims. Hence the <hi>Order</hi> of thoſe that <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> to the <hi>Sick</hi> had its Originall; whoſe firſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituter</hi> was <hi>Camillus Lellius,</hi> a man renowned for his vertues, and a great admirer of <hi>Philip.</hi> Here it muſt not be paſſed over, that <hi>Philip</hi> affirmed, how when two of this <hi>order</hi> were one time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to God the <hi>Souls</hi> of the dying, he ſaw <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> wiſpering words in their ears: which thing he had often related to them, to encourage thoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons to ſo important a duty of piety; as is mentioned in their <hi>Chronicle.</hi>

                        <p>BEſides theſe the <hi>H.

Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of S. <hi>Saviours</hi> in the <hi>Camp.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Philip</hi> and about <hi>fifteen</hi> more met, where beſides the frequent uſe of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and other religious exerciſes, they communed about ſpiritual matters with great devotion, provoking one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Chriſtian perfection. The firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> of every <hi>Moneth,</hi> and yearly in <hi>Holy week</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> according to the cuſtom of the Church, they for the ſpace of forty hours expoſed the B. <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in moſt <hi>ſolemn manner;</hi> at the performing which <hi>Philip</hi> diſcourſed of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things (ſometimes at each hours end) with ſuch fervency of Spirit, as there was none ſo hard and inflexible, but relented while he ſpake: and once it fell out, that at one throw (letting down the <hi>net</hi> of Divine exhortation) he drew up <hi>thirty</hi> young men together who ſtuck faſt in the mudd of an impure converſacion: yea divers that came to jeer, ſeeing a <hi>Lay-man</hi> preach (a thing then unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall) ſtruck with the force of his words betook them to the practiſes of a holy life.</p>
                        <p>During the time of theſe prayers, he for the moſt part ſpent a day and a night in heavenly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; and at the end of each hour by a ſignall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114712:20"/> diſmiſſed them that prayed, calling up others, and ſaying, <hi>See Brethren, the houre indeed is ſpent, but never the time of doing well.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of this <hi>Society</hi> (which continues at this preſent) was, that <hi>Pilgrims</hi> coming to <hi>Rome</hi> out of devotion, might be hoſpitably entertained: which in the <hi>Jubile</hi> following under <hi>Pope Julius</hi> the <hi>third</hi> began to grow to a perfect work. For the number of thoſe that came to the City being in theſe years much greater, and no place ſetled for poor and ſtrangers to lodg in, <hi>Philip</hi> and his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates moved with charity courteouſly received them: and the reſort increaſing exceedingly, there was a neceſſity of hiring a larger houſe to lodge the many comers the more conveniently.</p>
                        <p>This charitable work excites divers to the like: in ſuch wiſe, that every day you ſhould ſee, whilſt whole multitudes of travellers flocked in from all parts, ſome waſhing their feet, others bringing them victuals, others making their beds; ſome comforting the diſtreſſed, inſtructing the Ignorant, all diligent in doing all offices of charity and piety. So that the good <hi>ſavour</hi> of this <hi>Order</hi> diffuſing 'its fragrancy abroad far and wide, ſundry were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of entring into it.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of this <hi>fraternity</hi> (who all reverenced <hi>Philip</hi> as their Father) though but meanly accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with temporals, had nevertheleſſe a rich fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of their own vertues; for he that had the loweſt office among them, ſerving in the <hi>Kitchin,</hi> arrived to ſo high perfection, that going many times at midnight from his lodging, looking up to heaven he would be even rapt with the meditation of things divine. Another likewiſe of the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety foreſeeing the day of his death, ſends for his

                        <p>Further theſe pious, and compaſſionate men, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſick men turned out of the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> before they were quite recovered, oftimes relapſing with greater peri of their lives, appointed that ſuch for ſome dayes ſhould be relieved here, till they were perfectly well. All which, being daily augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enlarged, was for conveniency removed from the Church of S. <hi>Saviours</hi> to that place where the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>H.

                        <p>And to effect it the better, laying all aſide, he gave himſelf wholly to the hearing <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſmall number of <hi>Penitents,</hi> and conſidering what great advantages accrewed thereby, beſtowed part of the night alſo herein: and betimes in the Morning gave audience to others confeſſing to him in his Chamber; for whoſe conveniency he layd the <hi>key</hi> of his <hi>door</hi> in a conſtant place, that they might have acceſs to him at their pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as ever the <hi>Church-doors</hi> were open, he ſtraight betook him to his <hi>ſeat</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> which he left not uſually, except to ſay <hi>Maſs,</hi> or when ſome urgent occaſion called him away. When none

                        </p>
                        <p>Neither was it enough in his opinion to allure many by theſe artifices, but he alſo laboured to ſtrengthen and confirm them in the ways of God. To which end he took order for their meeting in his chamber after dinner, (for at thoſe hours the wiſe man knew the incurſions of the Noon-day devil were moſt of all to be avoided and withſtood) where gathering round about him, he either ſitting or reſting on the bed, propoſed ſome moral ſubject, as the beauty of <hi>vertue,</hi> or <hi>deformity</hi> of <hi>vice,</hi> or elſe the <hi>life</hi> of ſome <hi>Saint,</hi> whereto every one contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his part.

                        <p>This man was ſuch a maſter of his affections, that he who lately ſtalked through the City, gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly array'd, attended with a numerous train of ſervants, having once reliſhed the <hi>Spirit,</hi> began now utterly to abandon the empty oſtentation of ſuch <hi>State;</hi> yet <hi>Philip</hi> wiſhed him to go well ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114712:23"/> and keep a competent Retinue for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his houſe.

                        <p>Before this, <hi>Philip</hi> had long ſince brought <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> the <hi>Wiſe</hi> of this <hi>Salviatus,</hi> one of the <hi>Maximi,</hi> to a wonderful height of Piety; for living a <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> ſhe reſolved on ſome ſtricter courſe of ſerving God; and thereupon withdrew unto a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of <hi>Religious Virgins:</hi> but not having her health well at <hi>Florence,</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, entring into the <hi>Nunnery</hi> of <hi>S.

                        <p>Next <hi>Salviatus</hi> was <hi>Francis Maria Tauruſius Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litianus,</hi> allied to two <hi>Popes, Julius</hi> the third, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> the ſecond; a man of great parts, and for his excellencies and abilities of mind by the <hi>Princes</hi> highly eſteemed, and of much repute at <hi>Court.</hi> He, upon occaſion of a certain <hi>Indulgence</hi> at that time publiſhed, went to the <hi>Church</hi> of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom a Charitate</hi> to <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and found the <hi>good man,</hi> never unprepared to ſuch offices. When he had done <hi>Confeſſion, Philip</hi> had him to his chamber; where, after many and ſeveral diſcourſes, he took an occaſion to deſire him to go and pray with him one hour. <hi>Tauruſius</hi> yielded to it; and found in that ſpace ſuch a guſt of heavenly things, that the hour ſeemed leſs then a minute to him.

But withheld by ſome obſtacles from thoſe purpoſes of ſerving God, he acquaints <hi>Philip</hi> with them; who bids him <hi>Go, and rest contented; for thoſe lets that now hinder you within a moneth will be over:</hi> and at the moneths end returning to the <hi>H. man</hi> well quieted and at eaſe, he confeſſed to him, with great contrition and remorſe, the ſins of his whole life; and finding in Confeſſion that <hi>Philip</hi> could diſcover his very thoughts and imaginations, became ſuch a lover and admirer of him, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the Pomp and ſplendour of the <hi>Court,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up himſelf wholly to his conduct.</p>
                        <p>This man had ſo burning a zeal, and fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as needed more correctives to allay, than incentives to excite it: and he ſo wholly depended in every thing upon the Divine pleaſure, that he never loſt the tranquility of minde, which he had at his firſt converſion. He highly reverenced <hi>Philip;</hi> ſo that being <hi>fourſcore</hi> years of age, and dignified with the <hi>Cardinals purple,</hi> he gloried moſt, that he had laid his ground-work in <hi>Christs School</hi> under <hi>Nerius</hi> for above fifty years. He was famous for the gift of prayer and tears. He was ſo excellent at making familiar Sermons, that he is ſtiled by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Annals, Dux Verbi; the Chieftain of the Preachers. Clement</hi> the <hi>eighth</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him firſt <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Avignion:</hi> and then conferred on him the <hi>Cardinal</hi> Dignity: when he was in years he earneſtly beſought the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that he might return to them, and end his dayes in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> they all aſſented; ſo, not long after,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114712:24"/> in the year of our Lord 1608. and of his age the 82<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and the eighth moneth, he devoutly ended his life, and lies buried in the Church.</p>
                        <p>There was beſides, among the ſons of this H. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Constantius Taſſonius,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Peter Bertanus Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Phanum,</hi> who being ſo great a Courtier as he was thought never to be weaned from the world, yet by his converſe and acquaintance with <hi>Philip,</hi> retired from Court, and arrived to a moſt eminent piety, there being not the meaneſt duty of charity which he would not moſt willingly undertake: Thrice a week, and for the moſt part, every day, he opened himſelf to his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and fed on the Bread of Heaven: went every day to Hoſpitals and Alms-houſes; refuſing no means of conquering his own will, impoſed on him by <hi>Philip.</hi> When he was made Prieſt he ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> every day: ſo averſe to riches and <hi>Church-preferments,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered a <hi>Benefice</hi> of a conſiderable value, he rejected it. For his extraordinary Sanctity and Vertue he was by S. <hi>Carlo</hi> ſollicited to come to <hi>Millain,</hi> where he continued in his family to his dying day in high eſtimation; at laſt being diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Rome</hi> by that <hi>H.

                        <p>Beſide theſe he had other <hi>Sons,</hi> of mean rank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but of illuſtrious piety. Of which the firſt was <hi>Steven</hi> a ſhoe-maker of <hi>Arimium,</hi> who lately living a Souldier led a diſſolute and profane life,

He was ſo propenſe to works of mercy, that albeit he lived poorly, yet of that he got weekly in his trade, abating neceſſary diet, he diſtributed the reſt among the poor. He continually medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his latter end, preparing himſelf thereto, no leſs than if he had bin to dye that day: yet his daily thinking thereon made him not alter his countenance, nor leave his wonted chearfulneſs. He was ſtrict in his obedience, and much in prayer, in which he received many and great favours from our Lord; particularly this that in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>H. Trinity</hi> he was ſeen to ſhine with a marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous brightneſs. Thus ſequeſtred from all kinde of company, lived he in a ſmall cottage about 23 years, and being adviſed by his friends (ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might dye ſuddenly without notice taken) not to live alone, he made anſwer, that he relyed on the B. <hi>Virgins</hi> patronage, and doubted not, but that pious <hi>Mother</hi> would aſſiſt him in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent. Nor was he miſtaken in the event, for one night being like to dye on the ſudden, he went out and called ſome of his neighbours to ſtay by him,

                        <p>Next to <hi>Steven</hi> was <hi>Francis Maria</hi> firnamed <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarienſis</hi> an honeſt and upright man, one who could <hi>ſmell</hi> a filthy <hi>stench</hi> in <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſometimes had heard the <hi>muſique</hi> of <hi>Angels:</hi> when he <hi>communicated</hi> (which he did every day) or diſcourſed about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matters he would even melt into tears.

                        <p>His intents he declares to ſome his chief famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, in number about <hi>twenty,</hi> of whom was <hi>Tauru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> of theſe ſome he wiſhes to become <hi>Prieſts,</hi> only that thereby having procured the <hi>Apoſtolical Benediction</hi> they might take a voyage to the <hi>Indies.</hi> But becauſe he would not enterprize nor determine any thing of moment but by advice, <hi>prayer,</hi> and the advantage of <hi>time,</hi> uſing longer Prayers then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he went to a <hi>Monk</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>S.

                        <p>This man was in eſteem for knowledg and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, by his parents dedicated to God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ere he was born into the world. For his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Parents, having duely <hi>confeſſed,</hi> and received the <hi>B.

                        <p>To this Reverend perſon <hi>Philip</hi> relates what he had deſigned, and requeſts his advice aceording as the matter imported, he deferred in it, and bids him come again, that ſo he might give him a more punctuall anſwer. At the day appointed when <hi>Philip</hi> came, he returned him this anſwer; S. <hi>John the Evangeliſt</hi> had appeared to him, and told him plainly, that <hi>his Indies ſhould be at Rome, and that</hi> God <hi>would uſe his ſervice there for the good of many:</hi> telling him further that the <hi>Three Fountains</hi> ſeemed to him of bloody tincture, which, as <hi>S.

                        <p>One time he travelled with <hi>Proſper Cribellius,</hi> one of his <hi>Sons,</hi> whom he loved well, to S. <hi>John Laterans;</hi> into whoſe companie a <hi>Jew</hi> chanced to light; as they went into the <hi>Church,</hi> reverently kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Altar,</hi> where was the <hi>H.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114712:28"/> then at S. <hi>Hieroms.</hi> They did ſo, and were kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained by the <hi>H. Father,</hi> whoſe ſweetneſs and civility ſo tranſported them, that for ſome moneths together they conſtantly called on him at certain times; afterwards when they left coming, <hi>Philip</hi> ſends for <hi>Marcellus,</hi> bids him carefully look out thoſe young men. He goes to their houſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of their Mother, if they were well: <hi>ſhe</hi> tells him one of them lay dangerouſly ſick; he deſired to have acceſs to him, and, as God would have it, was admitted: when he came into the Room he findes him like to dye; his diſeaſe having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſtomack quite, ſo that he refuſed all meats. The woman requeſts <hi>Marcellus</hi> to offer him meat if happily he would take it from his hand: he did, and the young man accepts whatſoever he offers. <hi>Marcellus</hi> when he ſaw his time, <hi>whiſpers</hi> in his ear. <hi>Philip remembers him kindly to you:</hi> at which, he was much pleaſed and ſmiled. Then <hi>Marcellus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you promiſed Philip you would become a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; I well remember it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and will ſtand to my word.

The <hi>H. man</hi> replied, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114712:28"/> ſuffered their ſociety, for that he hoped by the <hi>ſons</hi> means to gain the <hi>Father</hi> to Chriſt alſo. And he was not deceived in it, for as ſoon as the <hi>Son</hi> but brought his Father to <hi>Philip,</hi> he diſcourſed with ſuch fervent charity, and forcible eloquence of <hi>true faith</hi> in God, that being enflamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he quickly was baptized, and admitted into the number of the <hi>faithfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some years after, when Philip went from S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> to <hi>Vallicella,</hi> the ſame man having four <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,</hi> Orphans, was ſolicitous to keep them from converſing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that ſo being inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the myſteries of religion, they might be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the faith of Chriſt: theſe therefore, their affectionate <hi>

                        <p>THis ſo vehement zeal of propagating the faith would not be confined to the limits of <hi>Rome,</hi> but diffuſed it ſelf far and wide unto the moſt diſtant quarters of the Chriſtian world. For perceiving that in ſome <hi>Northerne</hi> countries the enemies of the <hi>Catholique faith</hi> daily broached new and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrines, he, on the contrary pitying the great ruine of Souls, reſolved to oppoſe himſelf. Thereupon by ſpeciall directions of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God he enjoyned, that in the <hi>Oratory</hi> (of which anon) one of his Scholars as oft as he preached,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114712:30"/> ſhould bring down the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall ſtory</hi> in order, from the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that ſo, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, truth, and progreſs of the <hi>univerſall Church</hi> expoſed to open view, and the craft and cheats of <hi>hereticks</hi> diſcovered, neither the Ignorant might be led into error, nor the Learned pretend any excuſe.</p>
                        <p>For this task he made choice of <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> of <hi>Sora, Doctor</hi> in either <hi>Law,</hi> a man renowned for ſacred ſtory, and noted for good life, who being but a private perſon was ſo liberall a <hi>benefactor</hi> to the poor, that he beſtowed all his houſhould-ſtuff, to a ſilver <hi>cabinet</hi> of a good value, and of much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with him, yea his very apparell toward their maintenance: and ſo great a deſpiſer of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that he tore his <hi>priviledge of Doctor,</hi> meerly in contempt of himſelf. Him therefore the <hi>H.

                        <p>Which ſo noble and admirable work is to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed rather to <hi>Philip</hi> than <hi>Baronius,</hi> as in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face on the eighth <hi>Tome</hi> he hath left upon record, for the clearing of which, his own words are ſet down at the end of this <hi>treatiſe.</hi> Adde hereunto, that <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf a little before he died, calling <hi>Baronius</hi> to him, ſaid, <hi>Think but meanly of thy ſelf,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>for theſe works are not the iſſue of thy pains and ſtudie; but a gift of the Divine Bounty rather:</hi> when repeating the ſame again and again, <hi>True Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> replied <hi>Baronius, for whatever is in them is all next</hi> God <hi>owing to your prayers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame is confirmed by a viſion from heaven,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114712:31"/> which appeared to him not long before he ſet about the compiling his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> For when firſt he began to preach in the <hi>Oratory,</hi> he uſed to thunder out the terrors of <hi>de ath and hell:</hi> which after he had a while practiſed, <hi>Philip</hi> by direction of the <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> foreſeeing that, if he changed the ſubject of his diſcourſe, it would prove more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall both to himſelf and others, adviſed him to apply himſelf to the compoſing his <hi>Eccleſiaſtique ſtory,</hi> and leave preaching <hi>death</hi> and <hi>hell:</hi> at that time <hi>Baronius</hi> did not oppoſe, but his <hi>genius</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the other way, afterward neglected his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: ſo that <hi>Philip</hi> by vertue of his authority commanded him ſpeedily to go about the task he had ſet him.

                        <p>SEing therefore <hi>Philip</hi> determined to beſtow his pains at <hi>Rome,</hi> in winning ſouls to God, and the number of penitents daily encreaſed, that the place though large could not hold them: in the year 1558. He obtained of the deputies for the chief <hi>convent</hi> of <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> that part of the <hi>Church,</hi> which lies on the <hi>right</hi> ſide of the <hi>Chancel</hi> above the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> where he erected the <hi>Oratory,</hi> whither he removed the <hi>Conference</hi> held before in his Chamber.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Oratory</hi> is yet to be ſeen, but more ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and neatly built; to which the <hi>R. R. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> daily reſort to prayer, and on Holy-days preach to the great benefit of ſouls.</p>
                        <p>Hither therefore did <hi>Phiiip</hi> with his <hi>Sons</hi> retire every <hi>afternoon</hi> to their <hi>Spirituall exerciſes;</hi> which ended, he would lead them, on <hi>worky days</hi> to ſome open place of the <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Suburbs; on feſtivals</hi> to ſome Church or other: and hence came the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of having the daily repaſt of the word of God, and that familiar way of preaching inſtituted by the <hi>H.

                        </p>
                        <p>But theſe beginnings of the <hi>Infant Oratory</hi> none better can delineate, then he who knew them ſo exactly, and deſcribed them ſo copiouſly, <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> For in the firſt <hi>Tome</hi> of his <hi>Annals,</hi> treating of holy meetings, ſuch as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> mentions to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

                        <p>The manner of their journey was thus. On the day appointed they all came ſingle, or in companies to <hi>S. Peters</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> without the walls, where putting themſelves into ranks, they went forward to the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: as they paſſed they ſpent part of the time in meditation on ſome ſet ſubject out of the ſacred mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries (the multitude being diſtributed into <hi>Claſſes,</hi> unto every of which a Prieſt was aſſigned) the reſt of the time was taken up in ſinging <hi>Hymns, Pſalms, Spirituall ſongs, and Letanies,</hi> the <hi>Muſiques</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: if any of the day remained over, they conferred of religious matters.</p>
                        <p>In every Church, except thoſe <hi>two</hi> mentioned,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114712:34"/> one of their <hi>own,</hi> or ſome other made a ſhort ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the people: but when they came to S. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtians</hi> or S. <hi>Stevens</hi> Church, <hi>Maſs</hi> was celebrated with all ſolemnity, where all of them well nigh received the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Thence they went to the gardens of the <hi>Maximi</hi> or <hi>Creſſcentii,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to thoſe of the <hi>Matthaei</hi> in Mount <hi>Caelius</hi> (yet at this day they (with their <hi>permiſſion</hi>) viſit thoſe only of the <hi>Matthaei</hi>) in which every one ſitting in his order, a table was furniſhed with bread and wine ſufficient, and an egg, a piece of cheeſe, with an apple added thereto. At dinner the Singers entred ſinging and playing to ſome holy <hi>Antheme:</hi> when table was taken away, they went to the other Churches; and ſo home, every one greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
                        <p>Theſe religious proceſſions were wholly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Philip,</hi> who took ſuch pains therein, that by overmuch wearying himſelf he ſometimes fell into a fever, but in his latter years, both by reaſon of age, and becauſe the Inſtitution was already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſetled, he ſtaid at home and performed other pious duties.</p>
                        <p>How pleaſing a work unto God that was, though it appeared not by down-right miracles, yet was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably declared by ſundry divine intimations. Once as his manner was, he went about <hi>Carnevall-time</hi> to theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> and in the way from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> to S. <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> aroſe on the ſuddain ſo great a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, that all thought of betaking them to their heels; but <hi>Philip</hi> bade them, <hi>Stay and be confident for</hi> I <hi>will warrant,-none that goes with me ſhall ſuffer much by this ſtorme.</hi>

                        <p>Hence grew a cuſtome after <hi>Eaſter day</hi> of going to that part of the <hi>Janiculum,</hi> where S. <hi>Onuphrius's</hi> Monaſtery ſtood; a place open to the Sun, and pleaſant for its overlooking the City lying beneath: yet as the heat of the weather increaſed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to ſome ſelected Church to perform theſe ſervices. Where after the melody of voyces, a little Boy makes a pious Oration to the Auditors, got by heart, and ſtraight <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi> (the Muſiques at whiles interpoſing) make ſome ſhort diſcourſe to the people.

                        <p>Theſe firſt <hi>Fathers</hi> kept up this cuſtome of going thrice a day from <hi>S. John</hi> to <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> ten years.

                           <q>Some days ago (this was in 1576) I uſed to frequent the <hi>Florentines Oratory</hi> dedicated to <hi>S.

                        <p>All theſe diſgraces the <hi>ſervant</hi> of Chriſt took no notice of, but carrying himſelf courteouſly to them both in word and deed prayed to God for them every day: and being deſired by ſome of his <hi>own</hi> to remove ſomewhither elſe: <hi>Not ſo,</hi> replyed he, <hi>I will not ſeem to ſhun the croſs</hi> God <hi>hath allotted me here.</hi> And ſtill the milder he, the more inſolent they; though he ſtrove, as for his life to ſoften their perverſneſs.

                        <p>BUt though <hi>Philip,</hi> thinking ever meanly of himſelf, never dreamt, as he ſaid, of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Congregation,</hi> yet at laſt, his ſons earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importuning him to it, he gave way: but to the eſtabliſhing ſuch a work, they thought it moſt imported, to purchaſe a ſeat of their own, where they might lay the foundation of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and execute their own laws and ſtatutes.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>H. Man</hi> was muſing thereon, two Churches very fit for that purpoſe were propounded to him; S. <hi>Mary's</hi> on <hi>Monticellae,</hi> and S. <hi>Mary's</hi> in <hi>Vallicellae</hi> and being in ſuſpence, which to make choice of (the better to underſtand the mind of God in a buſineſs of that concernment) he determined to refer the matter to <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the <hi>thirteenth</hi> to be decided; who wiſhed him to chuſe the <hi>Vallicel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> as being in a place of great reſort, and fitter for ſervice. He perceiving it to be Gods will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently caſt about to procure it, committing unto <hi>Tauruſius</hi> the managing thereof, who obtained of the <hi>Pope</hi> not the Church alone, but what ever elſe the <hi>Fathers</hi> could deſire. So this <hi>ſervant</hi> of Chriſt, back'd with the <hi>Authority Apoſtolique,</hi> inſtituted at <hi>Vallicella</hi> the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>ſecular Prieſts,</hi> which he entitled of the <hi>Oratory;</hi> and got liberty for framing <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> but with <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> that after a certain time they ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the <hi>See Apoſtolique.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having poſſeſſion of this Church, he appoints
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114712:41"/> over it, <hi>Germanicus Fidelius</hi> and <hi>John Antony Luccius,</hi> men of known integrity: but becauſe it was too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſomething ruinous, they thought of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to ſome better form; they were deſirous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to rebuild it from the foundation; but their mony being ſhort they waved that. When ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly one day, betimes in the morning <hi>Philip</hi> by divine inſpiration commands the old Church to be utterly raſed, and a new one raiſed in the form and bigneſs as we ſee at this day.</p>
                        <p>So the old Church being levelled with the ground, as <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Tifernum</hi> that famous <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi> in thoſe days, was caſting with his line the breadth of the new Church, <hi>Philip,</hi> then about to ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> at <hi>S. Hieroms,</hi> ſends a meſſenger to bid him let all alone till he came. When <hi>Maſs</hi> was over, he diſpatches for <hi>Vallicella;</hi> and as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding on the latitude, he bids lengthen out the line further; <hi>Matthew</hi> doth ſo; he bids enlarge it more; he obeys him again; the <hi>B. man</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the place was to narrow commands a third time to extend the line further yet. As ſoon as he came to the place that had been revealed to <hi>Philip; Here ſtay,</hi> faith he, <hi>here break up the earth.</hi> And as they were digging they light upon a hard wall, old and hid under rubbiſh, on the right ſide of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> ſome ten handfulls broad, and longer than the Church; beſides a huge pile of ſtone and brick, enough for the foundation, and for raiſing the wall on the right ſide. So on the 19 of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1575. the firſt ſtone conſecrated with ſolemn rites was laid by <hi>Alex. Medices, Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Florence, Cardinal</hi> of the <hi>H. Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who after tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the <hi>Popedome</hi> was named <hi>Leo</hi> the XI.</p>
                        <p>As the building went up their enemies raged ſtill
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114712:41"/> worſe, hindering the workmen, ſlandering the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; with croſs-bows and ſtones pelting <hi>John Antony Luccius</hi> Overſeer of the work: but alas! <hi>ſeven Brothers</hi> there were that oppoſed the buſineſs mainly, who died all within two years through the Divine vengeance.</p>
                        <p>The Church now almoſt finiſhed, in the year 1577. the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> on which day fel <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuageſima Sunday,</hi> the ſame <hi>Alexander Medices</hi> ſang <hi>Maſs</hi> publikely, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> performed divine duties there, and to enhance their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with the greater devotion, the <hi>Pope</hi> granted a plenary indulgence to thoſe who confeſſing their ſins, and receiving the <hi>H. Euchariſt</hi> were preſent at <hi>Maſs,</hi> or viſited the <hi>Church</hi> at all <hi>that</hi> day. And the ſame year in <hi>April</hi> quitting the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> they removed their uſuall ſermons to <hi>Vallicella; Philip</hi> ſtill tarrying at <hi>S. Hieroms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But becauſe the houſe was not big enough, the <hi>Fathers</hi> adviſed about buying a Monaſtery that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Church; for that the <hi>Nuns</hi> of the place, by command of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> were to remove to another <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of the <hi>Recluſes: Philip</hi> looking farther then the reſt, no way liked their counſell of buying it. Yet ſome of them attempted it on grounds of naturall prudence, but the buſineſs not ſucceeding, ſaith <hi>Philip, Did not I often tell you, this Monaſtery was not for our turns? ye ſhall indeed obtain a Monaſtery, but another way than ye dream of.</hi> He ſaid true; for <hi>five</hi> moneths after <hi>Peter Donatus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Cardinal, out of his great munificence bought that and other adjoyning houſes which he frankly beſtowed on the <hi>Fathers</hi> to dwell in.</p>
                        <p>The wonderfull confidence in God which <hi>Philip</hi> had for his atchieving this enterpriſe, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114712:42"/> from hence, that when there was no <hi>ſtock</hi> he adventured on ſo coſtly a ſtructure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated it in <hi>two</hi> years: oft ſaying when his money was ſpent, God <hi>will ſupply us;</hi> and coming ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a prime Lady in <hi>Rome</hi> he would tell her, Madam, <hi>you muſt know the B.</hi> Virgin <hi>and my ſelf have made a bargain, that I ſhall not dye till the</hi> Church <hi>be covered.</hi> Many therefore imagined that, ſeeing he never craved of any, and yet day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disburſed ſuch a deal of Money, either God furniſhed him, or miraculouſly increaſed his ſtore.</p>
                        <p>The firſt monies laid out in beginning the work were 200 crowns, given by the bounty of S. <hi>Carlo Borromeo;</hi> whereto <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. added 8000. and above, for the building and beautifying the forepart of the <hi>Church;</hi> beſides 4000. for erecting a Chappell in memory of the <hi>Preſentation</hi> of <hi>our Lady:</hi> likewiſe <hi>Cardinal Frederic Borromeo</hi> gave 4000. and the reſt, amounting to above a <hi>hundred thouſand crowns,</hi> God other wayes provided.</p>
                        <p>And to ſhew that he never asked any ones bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, it is not amiſs to adde this which followes. One of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> who had to do with the building, on a time told him, <hi>Father,</hi> the mony is ſpent, and yet the walls reach not to the roof: <hi>Doubt not,</hi> ſaith he, God <hi>will never be wanting to his Children.</hi> He replies; There is a rich man in the City that uſeth to diſtribute a large part of his revenues to pious uſes, if he were acquainted with our wants, he would happily help us with a good ſumm; at which <hi>Philip; The man knows in what need the building is, if he be minded he may freely contribute, for hitherto I have asked none, and yet have found no lack of any thing:</hi> and ſo it fell out, that within a few moneths a noted Lawer dying
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114712:42"/> bequeathed to the <hi>Congregation</hi> 4000 <hi>crowns,</hi> and more; and ſoon after another Lawyer died, and left 8000 by Will.</p>

                        <p>Now for that the ends of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Congregation</hi> are handled at large in the foreſaid <hi>Statutes,</hi> it ſhall ſuffice to inform the <hi>Reader</hi> here, how the moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> of all, by means of his ſervant <hi>Philip,</hi> introduced a new and differing, that is, a plain and familiar way of preaching <hi>Gods word</hi> in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both at S. <hi>Hieroms,</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Florentines</hi> obſerved, how exceedingly the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors edified by this popular kinde of Sermons; as ſoon as ever he came to <hi>Vallicella,</hi> he ordered, that every workiday, except <hi>Saturday,</hi> reading ſome godly leſſon before, there ſhould be <hi>four</hi> Sermons, each for the ſpace of <hi>half</hi> an <hi>hour;</hi> which ended, they concluded with ſome muſical conſort, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the Aſſembly.</p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:114712:44"/>
                        <p> At theſe <hi>four</hi> Sermons he was preſent every day for divers years, as were other both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the <hi>Congregation:</hi> and whilſt the <hi>Oratory</hi> was at <hi>S. Hieroms,</hi> he was not only preſent, but preached there himſelf every day.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe whom he called forth to this employment, he principally wiſhed to avoid <hi>Subtilties</hi> and <hi>School-queſtions,</hi> and to propoſe common Subjects, eaſie and ſutable to each ones capacity. To which end he aſſigned the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> to ſome of them to rehearſe; to others, the compiling the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Story;</hi> to others, the reciting <hi>S. Gregories Dialogues:</hi> advertiſing every of them by a familiar and eaſy ſtile to ſtir up a <hi>love of vertue,</hi> and <hi>hatred of vice</hi> in the affections of their Auditors. He counſelled them, if they ſought the good of Souls, to interweave ſome choice examples ſtill in their diſcourſes. If he heard any propound too difficult ſubjects, or too curious and quaint in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he would command him down out of the Pulpit, as one not only having reſpect with, but authority over them.</p>
                        <p>And leſt they ſhould forſake this low and facile way of preaching, he would not ſuffer them to dwell long at their ſtudies: ſo neither would he releaſe <hi>Baronius</hi> from theſe uſual exerciſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Annals were then in writing. Not that he would have Learning neglected, but rather that they ſhould apply themſelves to the reading of ſuch things as beſt ſuited with the Orders of the <hi>Oratory;</hi> for he would ſay, <hi>The ſervant of God muſt indeed learn the</hi> Sciences, <hi>but principally muſt avoid oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> adding <hi>That the knowledge of the</hi> H. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <hi>was to be got rather by</hi> prayer <hi>than</hi> ſtudy.</p>
                        <p>To theſe daily Sermons he added frequent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114712:44"/> for he gave order that the doors of the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> ſhould be opened every day for all ſorts of men, but no women: where for half an hour they uſed <hi>mental prayer,</hi> recited <hi>Letanies</hi> and other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as in the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> is mentioned more at large, and ſo diſſolved their meeting. He enjoyned that on <hi>Mondayes, Wedneſdayes</hi> and <hi>Fridayes,</hi> they ſhould ſcourge themſelves with <hi>cords,</hi> in memory of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> yet every one at his own diſcretion.</p>
                        <p>As touching the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> he deſired the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Congregation</hi> might ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> every day: although for exerciſe and tryal of their vertue, he ſometimes forbade ſome of them the doing it daily. He admoniſhed them in the time of celebration not to tire the ſtanders by; but rather ſtudy <hi>brevity</hi> then <hi>prolixity;</hi> alwayes allowing a competent time to ſo weighty a matter. He warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that if any found himſelf tranſported with holy inſpirations in the time of celebrating, he ſhould ſay, <hi>Not here,</hi> Lord, <hi>not here, but I deſire thee to reſerve thy ſelf for me in my chamber.</hi> Thoſe who were not <hi>Prieſts</hi> he wiſhed to confeſs thrice a week at leaſt, and to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of their <hi>Confeſſor:</hi> he adviſed all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> to take <hi>Confeſſions</hi> publickly in the Church every <hi>Holy day, Wedneſday,</hi> and <hi>Friday;</hi> on other dayes he would ſtill have <hi>one</hi> of them there for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>For matters of the houſe, he deſired <hi>his</hi> ſhould chuſe a mean, doing nothing that was ſingular. At times of refection, beſides the uſual reading, which laſted ſomewhat above half the meal, the reſt of the ſpare time was ſpent in propounding a <hi>couple</hi> of <hi>Questions</hi> by turns, morning and evening, either
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114712:45"/> pertaining to <hi>Morality,</hi> or taken out of <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> or the heads of <hi>Poſitive Divinity;</hi> which were modeſtly and briefly anſwered to by them at table, according to every ones ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the main of thoſe Orders <hi>Philip</hi> made in the <hi>Congregation:</hi> an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> ſince planted in many Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Provinces. The <hi>H. man</hi> was abſolutely of opinion, that each Houſe that was erected ſhould, reſembling <hi>his,</hi> give Laws to it ſelf, and be obedient to the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> of the place, independent on the <hi>Roman Congregation.</hi> Of which two <hi>Bulls</hi> are extant of <hi>Paul</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XV.</p>
                        <p>Yet ambitious he never was of augmenting his number. For when the fineſt wits, and hopefulleſt youths daily flocked to him, he would perſwade them either to go into ſome of the <hi>Regular Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or live as they were; thereafter as he thought beſt for them; but never would he entice any to his own <hi>Order,</hi> either by intreaties or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it. Yea if all ſhould have forſaken the <hi>Congregation,</hi> it had not a whit diſcouraged him; who uſed to ſay, <hi>God hath no need of men, for of stones he raiſeth up Children unto</hi> Abraham. If any attempted the like to his deſigne of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> it troubled not him: when <hi>one</hi> told him how ſome <hi>Regulars</hi> had taken up the cuſtome in <hi>their</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to make familiar diſcourſes, and that they were to be oppoſed; he wiſely anſwered, <hi>And whoſe gift is it that any prophecy?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In other things he governed his <hi>Body</hi> with much prudence and caution, and ſo demeaned himſelf, that he cemented <hi>his own</hi> faſt together in indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble bands of love and concord: affirming it was harder then men imagined to preſerve long unity
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114712:45"/> among ſuch as were otherwiſe at liberty, and out of ſubjection; which nothing doth more facilitate or ſweeten, than gentle conduct and moderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Yet did he never, when there was need of it, ſlacken or remit the <hi>reins</hi> of government; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome of <hi>his</hi> ſo at command, that with a <hi>look</hi> or <hi>beck</hi> he could rule them as he pleaſed: and it was uſual with him, whenſoever he would reprove any of them, but to look ſternly, and 'twas enough.</p>
                        <p>The deteſtable <hi>vice</hi> of <hi>diſobedience</hi> he ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated ever, that if any of <hi>his</hi> were found guilty therein, they were ſtraight diſcarded the <hi>Houſe.</hi> To which purpoſe he left in writing theſe words under his own hand: <hi>If any think he cannot hold out, by reaſon of, the meanneſs of dyet, the ſervices to be performed at</hi> Church, <hi>or the like, but will diſturb his fellows, let him freely and ſpeedily quit the place; if not, after a</hi> firſt, <hi>or</hi> ſecond <hi>offence let him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: for I am reſolved (ô ye Fathers) they ſhall not continue amongst us, who refuſe to obſerve theſe ſo few Orders.</hi> Thus <hi>Philip.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that all <hi>his</hi> might learn to deny their own underſtanding, he ſent them forth on buſineſs at ſuch unſeaſonable times and hours as ſeemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſon; and if they demurred never ſo little, he redoubled his commands, that ſo taming and maſtering their own wills, they might the ſooner arrive at the height of true humility. But what progreſs in piety he expected from <hi>his,</hi> and what an enemy he was to the refractory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the Letter which <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> ſent from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> while he tarried there with <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. to <hi>Conſolinus</hi> then Maſter of the <hi>Novices</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſufficiently teſtifies; where he writes.</p>

                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:114712:47"/>
                        <p> As he was once diſcourſing of the vertue of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to his <hi>Sons,</hi> by a certain fiſhpond; <hi>Which of you,</hi> faith he, <hi>will come to ſuch a pitch of Obedience,</hi> as to fling himſelf ſtraight into this water at my bidding? He had ſcarce ſaid it, and that <hi>occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> not in earneſt, but one of them, not ſtaying for a command, fetching his leap skips in, to the certain danger of his life, had not they which were by run in ſpeedily to his help.</p>
                        <p>One time he commanded <hi>three</hi> of them to walk naked through one of the notedſt parts of the City called the <hi>Bank.</hi> Strange! they begin to lay away their Coats, unbutton them, pull off their ſhoes, and without delay to fulfill his pleaſure; and had done it, but that he made them forbear and put on their cloaths again.</p>
                        <p>Another time, as he went by <hi>Veſpaſians Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre,</hi> to viſit the ſick in S. <hi>John Laterans</hi> Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as his cuſtome was, he light on a beggar ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground very ſick, and all dirty, whom compaſſionating, he beckens to one of his <hi>Sons</hi> to take him out of the dirt, and carry bim on his ſhoulders to the Hoſpitall.

                           <hi>Baronius</hi> was ill at his <hi>Stomack,</hi> and if he eat never ſo little, it became very offenſive to him; beſides ſuch a <hi>headach</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> for bad him to uſe much prayer, or do any thing that might take up his thoughts. So coming one day after <hi>dinner</hi> to the <hi>B.

Baronius</hi> thinking on the merit of Obedience, croſſing himſelf forthwith did ſo, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114712:47"/> recovered of either infirmity, both that of his <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> and his <hi>head.</hi> The ſame <hi>Baronius</hi> teſtifies, that for 9 years together going every day to attend the <hi>ſick</hi> at the Hoſpitall of the <hi>H.

                        <p>Again, whatever was done by <hi>Philips</hi> advice ſucceded proſperouſly, <hi>Fabritius de Maximis</hi> one of his <hi>Pupils</hi> whom he loved entirely, had <hi>two ſons</hi> that had been long ſick, one of which fed only on Broths and <hi>liquids,</hi> the other could hardly ſwallow at all. <hi>Fabritius,</hi> hoping if they went from <hi>Rome</hi> to ſome better air, they might poſſibly eſcape danger, conſulted the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> about it, whoſe opinions was, if they were removed from the City they could not live. It was <hi>July</hi> and in the <hi>dog-days,</hi> when <hi>Philip,</hi> being viſited by <hi>Fabritius</hi> and acquainted with all that paſſed, bids him <hi>Go, and fear nothing, let them be conveyed in a Litter, and they will recover without fail. Fabricius</hi> followed his counſel, and the next day had them to <hi>Arſolum</hi> 28 <hi>miles</hi> from the City: whither when they came they ſtraight mended as <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid.

                        <p>Another, a <hi>Roman</hi> lately married affirms, that as oft as he was at feaſts or ſhews with <hi>Philips</hi> permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was never anoyed with lewd imaginations; on the other ſide, if he went of his own head, he was perpetually moleſted with filthy thoughts.</p>

                        <p>On the contrary, many obſerved that thoſe who ſleighted <hi>Philips</hi> counſel or directions, moſt what came to an evill end. <hi>Francis Maria Tauru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> full of holy Zeal had often importuned <hi>Philip</hi> to let him riſe a nights to prayer, who regarding his infirm conſtitution denyed him.

                        <p>Another of <hi>Philips</hi> ſons without acquainting the <hi>Father</hi> whipt himſelf a days, and being troubled in conſcience about it, asked his leave, who told him <hi>I not only forbid you to do it every day, but for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at all.</hi> Yet he often beſeeching him for his conſent, <hi>Once aweek then,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip, I give you leave.</hi> Lo! within a little while after he falls down at the <hi>Good mans</hi> feet, crying, <hi>It repents me</hi> Father <hi>it repents me, for when the day comes for whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I am ſo loath to do it now, that I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it once, and therefore I acknowledge, what I did before with much delight, was but the content of ſatisfying my fond will.</hi>

                        <p> When he was ſick, he was ſo obſervant of his <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> that although he found much trouble in taking <hi>medicines,</hi> yet whatever they preſcribed him he willingly and cheerfully received. Yea though they enjoyned him to ſuſpend his prayers, or omit <hi>Maſs</hi> (which moſt grieved him) yet he did acquieſce in their Judgments. As once, a <hi>Phyſician</hi> forbiding him his <hi>Canonicall Hours,</hi> though otherwiſe moſt devoted to Prayer, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obeyed.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe he was wont to produce ſelect <hi>Aphoriſmes.</hi> as firſt: <q>That thoſe who intended to proceed in <hi>Chriſtian diſcipline</hi> ſhould ſubmit themſelves wholly to the commands of their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours:</hi> thoſe that were under no tye of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſhould be rul'd by ſome able and diſcreet <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and do nought without his advice; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that they which did ſo, ſhould render no account to the <hi>Supream Judge</hi> for actions of <hi>that</hi> ſort.

He ſaid further, That the ſhor teſt cut to Perfection was <hi>Obedience;</hi> more valluing them who for love to ſo noble a <hi>vertue</hi> lived but an ordinary kind of life under <hi>Obedience,</hi> than thoſe who <hi>voluntarily</hi> practiſed the moſt rigid <hi>auſterities.</hi> Withall he wiſhed them, to accuſtome themſelves to <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in the leaſt things, for by this means it would

                        <p>INtending to decipher the Vertues of <hi>Philip,</hi> it ſeemeth congruous to begin at <hi>that,</hi> which is the root, and ground of all the reſt, his <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> wherewith he was ſo fired that the inward flames lodged within his Soul broke out viſibly in his very body. So that rehearſing his <hi>Office,</hi> or diſcourſing of heaven, or the like, certain <hi>fiery raies</hi> were ſeen to flaſh out at his <hi>eys.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ardour of <hi>Divine Charity</hi> ſo ſcorched his heart that ſometimes the <hi>B. man</hi> would even lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for love; and at other times whether he ſtood or walked, his <hi>tongue</hi> would fly out in various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of holy affections.

I am filled with comfort, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with joy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When he went to Church to his prayers, he felt ſuch over flowings of the <hi>H. Spirit,</hi> that as ſoon as ever he kneeled down, he was forced to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for fear of an <hi>Extaſy.</hi> Sometimes his <hi>eyes</hi> were ſo ſet on heaven, that who ſo had ſeen him muſt needs have taken him for the <hi>bleſſed S.

                        <p>But though he were thus tranſported with theſe Divine <hi>favours,</hi> yet had it ſo pleaſed God, his deſire was to haue ſerved his <hi>H. Majesty</hi> without the <hi>guſts</hi> of ſuch ſenſible devotion. But to proceed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> He was carried with ſuch a longing deſire unto the H. <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that being yet a <hi>Layman</hi> he took this heavenly refection every day: and being made <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> daily, if he were well; if not, he received after the manner of Laicks: moſt what at <hi>midnight.</hi> Therefore toward the end of his life, that he might not be too troubleſome to his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, he procured of the Pope to have the <hi>Fucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> reſerved in a certain little Room neer his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, dreſſed after the manner of an <hi>Oratory;</hi> which Room when he was <hi>Canonized</hi> began to be in great <hi>veneration</hi> with all, and to be honoured with cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of <hi>Maſs</hi> there, and <hi>reſorts</hi> of the religious; and laſtly was of late years with ſolemnity tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to the new erected Church, as is to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>As oft as he was ſick, and the <hi>B. Sacrament</hi> brought him, as it uſed to be, after midnight, if the <hi>Prieſt</hi> came not juſt at the time, he was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in himſelf that he could not reſt: inſomuch
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114712:51"/> as being once dangerouſly ill, and hearing the Bell for <hi>Mattens,</hi> none having brought him his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaſt; for <hi>Tauruſius</hi> delayed the time leſt he might diſturb his <hi>reſt,</hi> he knowing the reaſon cals <hi>Tauruſius</hi> and tels him, <hi>Think not that</hi> this <hi>will be a means to keep me awake, but reach hither my</hi> Lord, <hi>and I ſhall inſtantly fall aſleep.</hi> So receiving the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> having ſoon after ſlept a while he began to be bettter, and quickly recovered. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time being ill, as <hi>Antony Gallonius</hi> held the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in his <hi>hand,</hi> tarrying longer than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ere he gave it him, he not able to wait longer ſaid, <hi>Ah,</hi> Antony, <hi>why keepeſt thou my</hi> Lord <hi>in thy hand, and giveſt him not to me ſo paſſionately deſiring him?</hi> when having taken the <hi>H.

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame mind and affections he deſired to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant in all his; exciting all <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> every day, unleſſe they were hindred by ſome urgent occaſion or <hi>let;</hi> nor would he take the excuſes of thoſe, who for ſome relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their minds remitted the frequency of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Maſs. For</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who ever looks for</hi> recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>but from his</hi> Creator, <hi>or</hi> conſolation, <hi>but from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſhall never finde either true recreation or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</hi> He was very deſirous that <hi>Lay-perſons</hi> ſhould oft partake of this <hi>Sacrament:</hi> therefore at his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> ſome of them every <hi>eighth</hi> day, ſome every <hi>Holy-day,</hi> others, but thoſe were few, <hi>every day</hi> feaſted on this <hi>Angelicall food.</hi> Yet he more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perſwaded them to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> than of the <hi>Altar.</hi>

                        <p>Being to ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> he was ſo rapt in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of celeſtiall things, that he was fain to divert his mind another way, for fear of <hi>Trances:</hi> and

                        <p>In receiving of the <hi>B. Bread</hi> he found ſuch <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>flavor,</hi> as if ſwallowing the pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>ſweet-meats:</hi> and therefore he picked out the

                        </p>
                        <p>But when he drank the blood of his <hi>Lord,</hi> he did ſo faſten on the <hi>Chalice</hi> with his <hi>lips</hi> and <hi>teeth,</hi> that he not only fetched off the <hi>gilt</hi> of it with hard ſucking, but left in the very <hi>Plate</hi> the <hi>prints</hi> of his <hi>teeth.</hi>

                        <p>Notwithſtanding in this <hi>ſacred office</hi> he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>quick</hi> than <hi>tedious:</hi> yet with ſo great a <hi>paſſion</hi> of devotion, that he would draw teares many times from thoſe that were by.</p>

                           <hi>Maſs</hi> ended, and thanks duly rendred, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his chamber, he would be ſo <hi>entranced,</hi> as not to be able to diſcern thoſe he met; and of ſo wan a viſage, that he reſembled one rather dead than living.</p>
                        <p>In his latter years, adviſing with ſome eminent both for their piety and their parts, he procured of <hi>Gregory XIII.</hi> that little chamber above mentioned, to celebrate <hi>Maſs</hi> in, with greater privacy and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Where, when the time of receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament came, diſmiſſing the company and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the <hi>lights</hi> all but <hi>one,</hi> the <hi>dovr</hi> and <hi>windows</hi> ſhut, he ſtaid behind alone: then his ſervant faſtned a note at the <hi>door</hi> with theſe words in it, <hi>Silence for the</hi> Father <hi>is at Maſs.</hi> About <hi>two houres</hi> after, the Servant came again, and knocked at <hi>door;</hi> when if <hi>Philip</hi> called or anſwered, he ſtraight unlockt the <hi>doors,</hi> opened the windows, and light the <hi>tapers,</hi> ſo the <hi>Father</hi> diſpatched the reſt of <hi>Maſs.</hi> But what paſſed there betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> themſelves only knew.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, adminiſtring the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to others, he was ſo enflamed with <hi>pious ardours</hi> that his whole

Inſomuch as a <hi>Woman</hi> then but newly converted to the faith, reports that ſhe ſaw the <hi>Servant of God</hi> holding a <hi>Pixe</hi> in his hand, whoſe body did ſo ſhake, that the <hi>H particles</hi> were ſeen raiſed up on high out of the <hi>Pixe,</hi> and he himſelf with an aſpect like <hi>fire,</hi> who preſently grew <hi>pale</hi> as aſhes.</p>
                        <p>The like befell <hi>Nerus de Nigris</hi> a <hi>Roman Lord,</hi> and a <hi>Patrician</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> one very much beloved of <hi>Philip;</hi> who came on a time to Church and brought one <hi>Barſum, Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with him, who was then <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> both of them receiving the <hi>Communion</hi> at the <hi>Fathers</hi> hands. Who, as he held the <hi>Pixe,</hi> was taken with ſuch a trembling, that <hi>Nerus</hi> feared leſt ſome of the <hi>H. particles</hi> ſhould fall down, and therefore with a beſeeming reverence caught his right hand and held it till he had taken the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> When they were gone, he told <hi>Nerus; You raiſed a great heat in me to day:</hi> for he perceived himſelf affected with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fervour, by the preſence of the <hi>Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In like ſort when he reached forth the <hi>Hoaſt</hi> at the <hi>Communion,</hi> to <hi>Julia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſina Rangonia</hi> a Noble and religious <hi>Lady;</hi> ſhe with thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſaw a <hi>conſecrated Wafer</hi> parted out of his fingers hanging in the air to the amazement of all.</p>
                        <p>He was raviſhed with devotion to the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our Lord.

From this continuall meditation on our <hi>Saviours Paſſion,</hi> grew his ſo vehement deſire of going to the <hi>Indies</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Withall he was ſo devoutly affected unto the moſt ſacred <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that at the very ſound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was even raviſhed. He was alſo hugely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in repeating the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf full of faith.

                        <p>BUt the ſignall reverence and ardent devotion with which he honoured the <hi>B. Mother of</hi> God, no language is ſufficient to expreſs: ſtyling her <hi>ſuas delicias, Amoreſque ſuos,</hi> his <hi>Darling,</hi> and his <hi>Love;</hi> oft uttering with his tongue the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> which he ever carryed in his heart: nay ſo tenderly did he affect her, that many times (as children uſe) he would liſpingly call her <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ſpent whole nights in prayer to her. At S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> he fell ſo deſperately ill, that his <hi>Doctor,</hi>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114712:54"/> appointed one to watch with him; who one night heard the <hi>H. man</hi> (ſuppoſing none nere him) in moſt friendly and familiar expreſſions talking with the <hi>Virgin of Virgins;</hi> that the whole <hi>night</hi> ſeemed to him gone like a minute; and when in the <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it rung to the <hi>Angels ſalutation,</hi> he miſtook it for the <hi>evening.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> ſtrangely approved this way of praying: for one of the <hi>Congregation</hi> being tempted, though unwillingly, about the unſtained purity of the <hi>H. Virgin,</hi> and intimateing ſo much to <hi>Philip,</hi> he preſcribed him the forementioned <hi>form,</hi> wherewith to ſalute the <hi>Mother of</hi> God; who aſſaying it, was ſoon freed of the trouble of the temptation.</p>
                        <p>He profeſſed many <hi>favours</hi> done him by the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:</hi> one was, that whenſoever he was diſquieted with <hi>evil ſpirits,</hi> or frighted with ugly ſights, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repairing but to her <hi>image,</hi> his fear left him immediately.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Fathers</hi> were buſy in pulling down the <hi>old Church,</hi> he that overlooked the work, bid the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by no means deface that part of the building where was kept a very ancient <hi>Pourtraicture</hi> of the <hi>B.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114712:54"/> it up with her hand, they did ſo, and viewing the place they eſpy a <hi>beam</hi> hanging in the <hi>air</hi> looſe from the wall, and amazed at the <hi>miracle,</hi> they ſhouted, and applying their engines took down the <hi>roof.</hi> This is that Image of our <hi>Lady</hi> which at this day is ſeen on the great <hi>Altar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was likewiſe favoured with divers Viſions and apparitions of her; let one ſerve for all; that famous one a little before his end, of which in its place.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the other <hi>Saints,</hi> he alwayes gave them ſingular <hi>veneration:</hi> and would have their Lives read daily to him for ſome <hi>houres</hi> together.

                        </p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114712:55"/> thoſe Reliques mentioned, puting them unto his <hi>breſt,</hi> and for his eaſe and ſatisfaction left them with him.

                        <p>Laſtly his devotion toward <hi>H.

                        <p>They that prayed with him were ſo enamoured on religious duties, that continuing in prayer for many hours together, they thought the time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

                        </p>
                        <p>A Young Noble man had for ſhame concealed ſome <hi>ſins</hi> of his in <hi>Confeſſion, Philip</hi> obſerved it; and looking earneſtly on him lets fall a ſhowre of tears; whereby he procured of God for his <hi>Penitent</hi> ſuch hearty ſorrow for ſin, that he likewiſe burſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears very plentifully: they both wept, were both ſilent; neither of them left weeping for a good ſpace, at length the young man fals down on his knees, detects all the foul corners of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; whom the <hi>B. Father</hi> affectionately embracing, and accepting his <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> diſmiſſed, aſſoiled of his faults, and ſatisfied in his mind. But <hi>Philip,</hi> being of a moſt mild temper, had not wept e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; till hying to his chamber, he there let loſe the <hi>reins</hi> to his ſorrows, to the full. After which the <hi>young man</hi> diſcovered to his former <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> the ſins of his whole life; and within few days comes and tels <hi>Philip,</hi> how he had diſcloſed all: to whom the <hi>Father</hi> anſwered, <hi>Though I heard not the</hi> Confeſſion <hi>of your life, yet be ſure, I exactly know all and every of the faults you have ever committed.</hi>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114712:57"/> 
                           <hi>Nay more then that, I tell you, now you carry a good face with you:</hi> (which kind of expreſſion the <hi>H. man</hi> uſed when he ſaw any of <hi>his</hi> reclaimed:) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>I beſeech you,</hi> Father, <hi>that you would obtain ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere contrition for me by your prayers to</hi> God; and had ſcarſe ſpoke the word, but he was immediately ſtruck from heaven with ſo profound a grief, as he ſaid, he never felt a greater in all his life.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Good man</hi> one time went to a Noble mans <hi>Mannour</hi> with <hi>Caeſar Baronius, Joh. Franc. Bordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Thomas Bozzius,</hi> and others. In the <hi>afternoon,</hi> about the time when uſually the ſermons begin in the <hi>Church, Philip</hi> on the ſudden enjoyned <hi>Bozzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to preach to them <hi>ex tempore,</hi> that thoſe who were there might not be wholly without benefit of the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He did, when ſtraight <hi>Philip</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomewhat in confirmation of what he had ſaid, as he was ſpeaking, there fell on him ſuch a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling all his body over, and ſuch aboundance of <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>ſobs</hi> came from him, that he was fain to break off his diſcourſe. This uſed to happen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as often as he ſpake of ſpirituall matters.</p>
                        <p>A certain <hi>Prelate</hi> ſurprized him once on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as he was reading the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> weeping exceſſively; who asking him, Father, <hi>what doth this weeping m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Another time <hi>Angelus Victorius</hi> a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> one, whom the <hi>Father</hi> loved, took him reading and crying over the lives of the <hi>Saints,</hi> when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the reaſon of his heavineſs, <hi>I lament</hi> ſaith, he, <hi>that this</hi> Saint, <hi>whoſe ſtory is in my hands, renounced the world, whereas I have never yet done the least good:</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:114712:57"/> and added, <hi>what,</hi> O Angelus, <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt ſee me beaten with</hi> cudgels <hi>thorow the City?

Nay rather lay on,</hi> Executioner, <hi>lay on ſoundly:</hi> and as he uttered theſe words the <hi>tears</hi> trickled down his cheeks.</p>
                        <p>If he but <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>ſpake</hi> at any time of the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> preſently the <hi>tears</hi> ran down. Once in <hi>Holy week</hi> he read the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt at <hi>Maſs,</hi> as the cuſtom is; when perceiving himſelf <hi>Rapt,</hi> he ſtrove by all means to divert his thoughts another way; but coming to the Sacred Hiſtory of Chriſts <hi>Death,</hi> unable to contain any longer, he gave ſcope to his <hi>ſighs</hi> and <hi>grones,</hi> all that were preſent wondring and weeping together with him. Yea very often upon the hearing one word only of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> he would melt into <hi>tears:</hi> otherwhiles wax pale, either hearing or ſpeaking of that <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi> Sometimes he could hardly breathe, other times he trembled every <hi>joint:</hi> So that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to forbear <hi>preaching</hi> publikely; and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Why?</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>Becauſe he had not ſuch ready parts: yet he abstained not formerly, for that the number of Preachers being but ſmall, what nature was defective in,</hi> God <hi>ſupplied.</hi>

                        <p>He went to <hi>dinner</hi> once to the <hi>Refectory</hi> of <hi>S. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xede,</hi> erected by <hi>S.

                        <p>When he adminiſtred the <hi>H. Communion</hi> to his Penitents, the Tears fell in ſuch plenty, that he was often forced to deſert the employment.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Divine Service</hi> he was ſo affected with the Melody of <hi>Church-Muſick,</hi> that he many times cried all the while. Being once in the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THis fervour of <hi>Charity,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Tears</hi> he obtained only by his frequent exerciſe of <hi>Prayer:</hi> which he was continually ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to, that he directed all thoſe Religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes he had inſtituted in the <hi>Oratory</hi> to this <hi>one;</hi> and therefore entitled it the <hi>Congregation of the Oratory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this Divine Study he ſo vigourouſly ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and made ſuch progreſs therein, that ſtanding, or walking his thoughts were ſtill fixed upon God; more naturally ſoaring heaven-ward, then the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> on this <hi>world</hi> tend groveling toward earth.</p>
                        <p>Many a time, whilſt his Scholars were diſcuſſing ſeveral and ſerious matters in his Chamber, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from their affairs, either caſt up his eyes to heaven, or croſſed his hands, or ſometimes fetched groans from the bottom of his heart. As he walked the ſtreets hee was ſo ſwallowed up of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ever and anon he muſt be plucked by the <hi>ſleeve,</hi> and put in minde to offer, or returne, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes.</hi> After dinner, that he might not injure the health of his body by too much intention of the minde, when he had a deſire to ſlumber or to reſt him, he was wont to call <hi>Gallonius</hi> and tell him, <hi>You know what to do, if you would have me ſleep:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he muſt call off his thoughts from the conſideration of things ſupernaturall, by variety of diſcourſe, or ſome pleaſant reading for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Indeed he felt that in himſelf, which he uſed to apply <hi>in generall</hi> to others: to wit, <hi>That a</hi>

                           <hi>man enflamed with the Love of</hi> God <hi>muſt arrive to that heighth of</hi> Chariy, <hi>as to be conſtrained to cry out;</hi> Let <hi>me alone</hi> Lord, let <hi>me reſt a while: for whoever is indiſpoſed to pray even at Noon, and after meals, hath not yet received the Gift of Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He never went upon any buſineſs that was not uſher'd in with Prayer either by himſelf or <hi>his:</hi> whence he gained ſo ſtrong a confidence, that he ſpared not to ſay, <hi>Give me but time to pray, and I am ſure to obtain of God what I ask.</hi> And at other times, <hi>Hoc volo, Hoc jubeo: This I will, this I command:</hi> and as he ſaid, it fell out ſtill. Briefly, by his perſeverance in prayer he attained even to ſupernaturall illuminations, that he knew exactly which of his had prayed that morning, and which not.</p>
                        <p>But though his whole life might truely be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one continued <hi>Prayer,</hi> yet he preſcribed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome <hi>ſet hours,</hi> to encreaſe his devotion there in. For in <hi>Summer,</hi> except ſome work of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hindred, he retired himſelf to the top of the houſe; morning and evening, where he might view heaven and earth: to that end, not only at <hi>S. Hieroms,</hi> but a <hi>Vallicella</hi> amongſt his own he built him a <hi>Cloſſet</hi> on the very Roof, a ſtory higher than the reſt. And in his latter dayes he went up to the leads of the Church: where he ſpent a good ſpace in holy Cogitations: yet if at any time he were called forth to any pious work, he came down ſtraight, and quitted his ſpirituall exerciſe, till having diſpatched his buſineſs he returned again; ſaying, <hi>He did not therefore reject</hi> Meditation, <hi>but left</hi> Chriſt for Chriſt; <hi>and that the force of</hi> Prayer <hi>was not hereby diminiſhed, but augmented rather.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Winter after <hi>Sun-ſet,</hi> he prolonged his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114712:59"/> Prayers to the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third</hi> hour of the night: and going to reſt, that he might riſe again to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er juſt at his time, he hung his <hi>Watch</hi> at the Beds head, by feeling of which he knew what a <hi>clock</hi> it was: and hard by his <hi>Crucifix</hi> he laid the <hi>Roſary</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> that when he wakened he might fall to his Prayers.</p>
                        <p>At ſome ſpeciall times in the year, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Festivals,</hi> and when publique or private ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required, his prayers were both longer and more intenſe. He watched, faſted, and prayed, on <hi>Good Friday</hi> all thoſe <hi>hours</hi> that the ſacred <hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> was kept apart by it ſelf in memory of his <hi>Buriall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He devoutly and attentivly recited his <hi>Canonicall hours,</hi> for the moſt part joyning a <hi>Companion</hi> to him, for he could not diſpatch them alone, by reaſon he was ſubject to rapts. He almoſt ever had his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary lying open, being wonderous carefull that no error paſſed in ſaying it; and if any chanced, though he ſeemed as one bereft of ſenſe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently corrected the miſtakes. When he was <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years old, Gregory XIV.</hi> remitted him his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> upon repeating the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the <hi>B. Virgin;</hi> which favour he at no time made uſe of. Nay if he were extream ſick, he appointed the <hi>Canonicall hours</hi> ſhould be rehearſed in his hearing at leaſt.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>Prayer</hi> he added <hi>Reading,</hi> and the daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing <hi>Saints Lives,</hi> alledging that, <hi>There was no better incentive to Piety then the</hi> Examples <hi>and</hi> Rules <hi>of</hi> Saints. Beſides thoſe lives gathered by <hi>Lippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> he commonly uſed <hi>Caſſians Collations;</hi> the <hi>Imitation of Christ,</hi> father'd on <hi>Gerſon;</hi> the <hi>Life of</hi> S. <hi>Katherine of Siena;</hi> and above all, the <hi>Acts of the</hi> B. <hi>John Columbine.</hi> For the Books of <hi>H.

                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:114712:60"/> he delighted much in <hi>S. Pauls Epiſtles.</hi> Thoſe whom he deſigned for preachers he counſelled to read their works chiefly whoſe names began with <hi>S.</hi> as <hi>S. Auguſtine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>And becauſe he was deſirous that People ſhould riſe from prayer rather <hi>cheared</hi> than <hi>tired,</hi> he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch, as he thought leſſe able to pray long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſhould often raiſe their devotion by certain ſhort <hi>Ejaculations:</hi> ſome of which more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed by him, are here annexed.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>Philip not herewith</hi> content, inroduced a cuſtom in moſt families in the City, of having a private <hi>Oratory</hi> in every houſe, where the whole number both of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women</hi> might aſſemble to Prayers.

                        <p>The <hi>Inſtructions</hi> given by him upon this ſubject were theſe. Firſt, he ſaid, <q>The beſt <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>

Next, the frequent uſing to maſter our affections: being wont to ſay <hi>He that went to pray, and could not bridle and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his</hi> Paſſions, <hi>was like a</hi> Bird <hi>not</hi> fledged, yet <hi>offering to fly.</hi> Being entreated by one of his <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents</hi> to teach him to pray, <hi>Be humble and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the</hi> Unction <hi>of the</hi> H.

He affirmed, that if in <hi>Prayer</hi> any one found his minde quiet and at eaſe, it ſignified either that what was asked was already beſtowed, or without fail would be very ſpeedily. He wiſhed his <hi>Sons</hi> to be ambitious of performing the greateſt ſervices for the love of Chriſt, not contenting themſelves with any mean degrees of Piety; but outvying (in Charity for example) if it were poſſible, the <hi>Apoſtles Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> that ſo, what they could not attain to in in the <hi>work,</hi> they might in ſome ſort arive at, in their <hi>intentions.</hi> Further, he warned them who gave themſelves much to Prayer, not too earneſtly or too long to gaze on holy pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, both becauſe it did offend the <hi>brain,</hi> and brought on illuſions. To ſuch as lay under any ſpirituall aridity, he preſcribed this remedy; that they ſhould proſtrate themſelves before God and his <hi>Saints</hi> like <hi>beggars,</hi> craveing with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall importunity and deſires their ſacred <hi>Alms</hi>

When behold! ſome <hi>ſixteen</hi> days after, he voluntarily lays a way his <hi>Lay-habit,</hi> comes to him <hi>ſhaven,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſins from the firſt <hi>dawning</hi> of Reaſon in him; ſurrenders himſelf intirely to the <hi>R. Father,</hi> and being made one of his <hi>Sons</hi> travelled apace in his purſuit after Holineſs, till at length full of years, he died, a little before <hi>Philips Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With like tenderneſs of Spirit and <hi>zeal</hi> of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did he reduce great numbers to Chriſt; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it grew a ſaying among many; <hi>As the Load-ſtone attracts Iron, ſo doth</hi> Philip, <hi>Souls:</hi> others cryed, <hi>Happy the day and hour wherein I was firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with</hi> Philip. For, the <hi>Reverend and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man</hi> liked not thoſe, who laid down the way of vertue too difficult, and laborious to their <hi>Penitents;</hi> for that, being thereby diſcouraged with the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it, either they would not enter upon't, or ſoon retreat.</p>
                        <p>And therefore he never much inveighed againſt thoſe gariſh dreſſes worn by women, but letting that paſs, laboured chiefly to make them in love with Chriſt; knowing that if once the flames of <hi>Divine Love</hi> were kindled in them, of themſelves they would caſt off all ſuch lightneſſes. When a Noble Lady once asked him, whether it were any offence for her to help her low <hi>Stature</hi> by wearing <hi>Chapines;</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>Take heed, you fall not.</hi> One of his <hi>Scholars</hi> wore a <hi>Collar</hi> plaited in great folds, He gently taking him about the neck told
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114712:63"/> him, <hi>I ſhould hugg you oftner, but that that theſe wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles hurt my fingers:</hi> and by this means both the the <hi>Lady</hi> left off her high <hi>Shoes;</hi> and the young man his fine <hi>Colars</hi> ever after.</p>
                        <p>From the ſame exuberant <hi>Charity</hi> it was, that his <hi>Chamber-door</hi> ſtood always open to all comers, reſerving for himſelf neither time, nor place; yea though he were ſick, yet did he admit any and at any hour. Many times when he was <hi>a bed</hi> diſpoſed to ſleep, he refuſed not to hear the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of as many as came, not enduring that any one ſhould go away from him ſad or diſquieted. Therefore he charged his Diſciples never to ſay; Philip <hi>is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, or retired to his Chamber:</hi> taking it very ill, if any tarried never ſo little for his coming, for which he often and ſoundly too chid <hi>Gallonius</hi> and others. And if the <hi>Fathers</hi> objected, that he too freely expoſed himſelf to all commers, he replied, <hi>I would have you know, that by ſpending whole dayes and nights for them, and no other way, have I brought unto</hi> Chriſt, <hi>thoſe who at this day are the moſt forward in his ſervice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence was it, that he boggled not at the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of weather, rain, cold, heat, nor the hazarding his own life for the ſaving ſouls. It was told him once, how a young Noble perſon went in danger of his life by haunting the company of a principal <hi>Lady</hi> in the City, on whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately enamoured; and though ſome of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent rank had attempted, but in vain, to change his reſolution, yet <hi>Philips</hi> diſwaſions prevailed ſo with him, that he not only deſiſted from his purpoſe, but ever after avoided her houſe; and if at any time the <hi>Coach</hi> that carried him made thitherwarap excuſing himſelf to the Company he would leap out, and take another way.</p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:114712:64"/>
                        <p> Thus the Servant of Chriſt, becoming all things to all, in a care of every ones Salvation, caught both poor and rich, noble and ignoble, learned and ignorant, young and old, men and women, ſuting his <hi>baits</hi> to each of them till they were drawn to Chriſt: whereby he ſo endeared <hi>his own</hi> to him, that ſome of them came to him almoſt every day, ſome again for 30 or 40 years viſited him <hi>twice</hi> aday, <hi>viz.</hi> mornings and evenings, all whom he welcomed with large expreſſions of kindneſs and affection: ſo that his Chamber, not without cauſe, was termed, <hi>The School of Sanctity, and Chriſtian mirth.</hi> And, though there wanted not ſome that blamed him for it, men of otherwiſe able judgment and integrity, yet he both learnt by experience and taught it <hi>his, That men are more Kindly and more eaſily brought to</hi> Chriſt <hi>by gentle and fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> means, than roughneſs and Severity,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet when need was, he knew how to ſhew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and uſe rigour. For, being ſent for to do ſome good upon a <hi>malefactor</hi> that was to be hanged, and comming into the Chappell, where he lay roaring on the ground; <hi>he,</hi> led by a Divine hand, catching him by the <hi>throat</hi> and daſhing him againſt the <hi>floor,</hi> cried aloud to him, <hi>Peace;</hi> at which word he became ſilent, trembled, and was converted; and ſoon after <hi>confeſſed</hi> twice to one who came to him, dying very patienly.</p>

Train up a</hi> child <hi>in the way he ſhould goe, and when he is old he will not depart from it:</hi> beſtowed ſpeciall care and pains in reclaiming young perſons, preventing <hi>ſin</hi> in them, and promoting them in the <hi>studies</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs. For which cauſe, he was not aſhamed, though he were ſtricken in years, and through continuall extream labour decay'd in ſtrength to lead them in troops along with him, and march through the <hi>Streets:</hi> diſputing with them in the ſeverall arts and Sciences, they were verſed in; that ſo ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating himſelf with them, he might have them at his <hi>beck:</hi> oft would he take them to the <hi>Highest</hi> and <hi>ſtatelieſt</hi> places about the City, where they might beſt have a moſt pleaſant <hi>view.</hi> of it; there did he play at <hi>Quoits with them,</hi> a ſport invented by him. After which himſelf retiring from them to a place more remote, he read with meditation a little Book of the <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any of <hi>his</hi> neglected frequently the <hi>Oratory,</hi> or the uſe of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> he preſently ſent for them, and with all tenderneſs and reſpective love won them to their wonted <hi>exercices</hi> again; Whereupon they many times proved more <hi>zealous</hi> in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God.</p>
                        <p>His ſuccesfull pains in training up Youth was ſo famed among the <hi>Regulars,</hi> that the <hi>Superiors</hi> would ſend their <hi>Novices</hi> to him for directions, as he thought beſt. Sundry times in the <hi>year</hi> he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114712:65"/> led all the <hi>Novices</hi> of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to the 7 <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> and ſometimes to beautifull <hi>green Plots</hi> where they were merry and dined; He, <hi>Good man,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that they had ſo handſomely, and withall harmleſly, recreated both their bodies and minds; ſaying oft to them as they were at dinner, <hi>Eat, my</hi> Sons, <hi>eat and make no ſcruple now; for it doth me good to ſee you cheerful and pleaſant.</hi> After <hi>dinner</hi> ſitting on the ground he excited them to all ſorts of <hi>Vertue,</hi> but eſpecially to <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance.</hi> So the day being ſpent, he brought them home from their innocent recreations.</p>
                        <p>He was ſingular in tolerating the <hi>ſports</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Children; who played cloſe by his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, making a noiſe both with their tongues, and hands, and that almoſt every day; yet he an <hi>aged</hi> man, and full of thoughts about important affairs, endured all with patience. Yea if any reproved them for it, at any time, if it came to his <hi>ear,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them this mild anſwer, <hi>Go, play; this only I deſire of you, ſin not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Noble man</hi> that uſed to come often to him, on a time hearing this <hi>buſtle</hi> asked <hi>Philip</hi> how he could endured ſuch a <hi>ſtir,</hi> who anſwered, <hi>Though they cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ft wood upon my back, I could bear it willingly, ſo they will forbear ſinning.</hi> to which purpoſe, one of the prime men in all the City, calling to mind how friendly <hi>Philip</hi> formerly had uſed him, told his companion weeping; <hi>When I was young and went much to</hi> Father Philip, <hi>I remember I was never polluted with any</hi> deadly <hi>ſin, but as ſoon as ever I left him, I fell fouly into this wretched kind of life, you ſee me in.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover the <hi>H. man</hi> would have young people by all means cheerfull; being offended, when he ſaw
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114712:65"/> any ſad; therefore he would ſtrike them a <hi>box</hi> on the <hi>ear</hi> ſometimes bidding them, <hi>Be merry:</hi> ſaying that, <hi>Thoſe who were naturally pleaſant were more tractable in the way of vertue, than the melancholique.</hi> Two <hi>Capuchins,</hi> an old and a young man, came one time to him, who looking upon them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the younger, to have made farther progreſs in Piety, he purpoſed to make triall of his ſpirit; ſo, taking occaſion, for that he had ſpit undecent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his preſence, he began to reprehend him ſharply and looking angrily at him bid him, <hi>Hence away</hi> Sloven, <hi>where were you bred?</hi> and taking off his <hi>Shoe</hi> made as if he would hit him on the <hi>head.</hi> But he retaining the ſame chearfullneſs of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, held his peace, and gave him the hearing. The Elder of them, unconcerned rhe while, took it hainouſly, as being naturally ſad. But <hi>Philip</hi> not ſatisfyed with once chiding, went on, <hi>Off with your Cloak, for you are not worthy to walk the Streets in ſuch a habit. With all my heart,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>eſpecially having well dined to day, and being not as yet acold. Philip</hi> at that ſeeming to be more enraged, thruſt him forth of the Chamber, who bore all patiently and without ſhew of diſlike took his leave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. No ſooner was he gone, but the H. <hi>man</hi> calling him again, hugging and embracing him ſaid, <hi>Cheer up, my</hi> Son, <hi>go on in this ſprightly and cheerful temper, for by this means you will ſoon attain to the top of Perfection:</hi> and ſo diſmiſſed him.</p>
                        <p>But though the <hi>R. Father</hi> approved of pleſancy, and alacrity in young folks; yet abhorred he light jeſts, ridiculous mirth, and the ſpirit of railing; ſaying that, <hi>Scurrility kept divine inſpirations from entring, and by degrees quenched the good Spirit, if any were.</hi>

                        <p> He loved to have the younger ſort buſy ſtill and employed about ſomthing, and therefore would bid them either ſweep the <hi>room,</hi> or make the <hi>bed,</hi> or carry a <hi>trunk</hi> or <hi>table</hi> to one place or other; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read, otherwhiles ſtring <hi>beads</hi> for <hi>Roſaries,</hi> and ſuch like; that ſo they might never be aſſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with idleneſs, a vice he was alwayes an enemy unto.</p>
                        <p>He was rather deſirous likewiſe, that they ſhould frequent the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> then of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;</hi> and gave two reaſons for it. Firſt, <hi>becauſe-when we receve the H.

A <hi>ſecond</hi> was; <hi>for that the more earneſtly we long after and purſue, the more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and devoutly we approach to this heavenly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. Therefore if any of <hi>his</hi> at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to communicate oftner, he would ſay, <hi>Sitientes, ſiitientes venite ad aquas, Come ye thirsty, ye thirſty come to the waters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> the better to reſtrain them from publique <hi>Shews,</hi> he gave order to have ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Actons</hi> of ſacred <hi>Story</hi> repreſented. And upon this ground wiſely inſtituted that laudable Cuſtome of viſiting the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> of the City about that time.</p>
                        <p>And to preſerve them unſpotted from all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he adviſed them, not to be alone in their Chambers after dinner; but meet together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh their minds with ſome vertuous communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: affirming that <hi>that time</hi> was the <hi>Noon-day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Royall Prophet.</hi> One thing allſo he ſeriouſly preſſed them to, that they ſhould

An hour after <hi>Philip</hi> was gone, comes the <hi>Enemy</hi> and tempts the <hi>Young man to preſumption</hi> on his own worth; of which this was a mark. The <hi>Letanies</hi> for the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the cuſtome is, were rehearſing, and when they came to thoſe words, <hi>A mala morte libera eum Domine: Free him from an ill death ô</hi> Lord, <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſmiled, and ſhaking his head ſaid; O <hi>he cannot dye amiſs who carries</hi> Chriſt <hi>in his heart;</hi> when preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiving the wiles of the ſubtile <hi>Fiend,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſaith he, <hi>pray to</hi> Chriſt <hi>for me, for what I ſpake juſt now, was by ſuggeſtion of the devil.</hi> No ſooner was he rid of that temptation, but the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> redoubling his blows, labours with all his might to keep him from uttering the <hi>H. name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> thereupon he cries out; <hi>Alas,</hi> Brethren, <hi>I cannot poſſible expreſs that which I moſt deſire.</hi> What is that? ſaid they, <hi>doth the Devil hinder you from mentioning the name of</hi> Jeſus? At which he nodded, as being ſo: then they replyed <hi>Keep</hi> Jeſus <hi>in your mind and that is enough.</hi> In the encounter he was fain to ſummon up all his powers, ſo that what with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of minde and motion of his body, he was all in a ſweat. Then was <hi>Philip</hi> fetch'd, who ſhewing the <hi>B.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114712:68"/> yet did not the wicked ſpirit depart; for not long after he ſought to ſeduce him from the <hi>Catholique Faith;</hi> perſwading him, that he ſhould eſcape this ſickneſs, all which he related to <hi>Philip,</hi> who bids him, <hi>Slight my</hi> Son, <hi>ſlight thoſe Satanical cheats, and ſay the Creed with me.</hi> He pronounced the words often over, but ſeemed to himſelf not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them; which <hi>Philip</hi> perceiving bids thoſe that were preſent rehearſe the <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which done, ſtraight the temptation ceaſed. The ſick perſon the while recollecting himſelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming courage defies his enemy in theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>whether thou wilt or no, O thou damned</hi> apoſtate <hi>I do believe.</hi> At laſt the wily <hi>Tempter</hi> ſtorms him afreſh and more fiercely, employing his utmoſt to engulf him in a <hi>Hell</hi> of <hi>deſperation.</hi> So aſſuming a deformed ſhape, he appears with a dreadfull aſpect to the ſick man, who appalled at the ſpectacle trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled every joint of him, changing his colour, rolling his eyes, and unable to maintain his ſtanding, roars out in bitterneſs of Soul, <hi>O caytive that I am! ah what a number of horrid crimes have I committed?

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114712:77"/> thoſe who, as it is in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> could not <hi>dig, and were a ſhamed to beg:</hi> for he full well knew, how heavy and ſad a condition it is for one formerly rich and Noble to be brought to poverty and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                        <p>He apportion'd a monethly allowance to certain <hi>Religious Houſes</hi> beſide the Almes he diſpenſed every day. Nay more he kept the particular <hi>names,</hi> of Religious <hi>places</hi> hanging at his Chamber door, and many times ſent them money.</p>
                        <p>It was his cuſtome, if he ſaw any pregnant youths that for want of ſubſiſtence were forced to quit their <hi>ſtudies,</hi> not only to find them <hi>food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but buy them <hi>books</hi> too, ſuch as were necſſary for attaining liberall Arts and Sciences.

                        <p>This ſo prodigious bounty, or profuſeneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God was pleaſed to approve by moſt evident miracles. For going one night to carry bread to an <hi>honourable</hi> but <hi>poor</hi> man, whileſt yet among the <hi>Laity,</hi> for haſt to avoid a Coach that was in full ſpeed, he fell head-long into a deep pit, when an <hi>Angel</hi> catching him by the hair of the head miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved him.</p>
                        <p>About the ſame time an <hi>Angel</hi> met him in the likeneſs of a <hi>poor</hi> man, deſiring an <hi>alms;</hi> to whom He offered willingly all the money he had; when the <hi>Angel</hi> ſeeing his good <hi>will,</hi> refuſing the money told him <hi>I came but to try what you would do:</hi> and ſtraight vaniſhed out of fight.</p>

                        <p> For this his Charity to the poor, and care of ſaving ſouls, he was generally termed, <hi>The</hi> Father <hi>of ſouls and Bodies.</hi> And many after his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting with themſelves the charitable Acts done by him in his life, their hearts melting in them at the remembrance thereof, could not but weep: and divers did frequently and openly affirm, <hi>Poſterity would never have</hi> his <hi>equall for liberality and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi>

                        <p>Nor was He only mercifull and compaſſionate, but exceeding thankfull and free. <q>So <hi>Cardinal Hieron. Pamphilius</hi> reports; The <hi>H. Father,</hi> when he lived, was even in the ſmalleſt matters moſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114712:78"/> gratefull to all ſorts of men, and ſo mindfull of any good <hi>turn</hi> done him, that he ever returned more than he received. <hi>Marcus Antonius Maffa</hi> ſaith thus; <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo <hi>civil</hi> a Perſon, that you could ſcarce ever faſten any kindneſs upon him, which by mutuall offices he requited not more than double.

                        <p>Yet although He ſhewed ſuch exemplary charity to the <hi>Poor</hi> he could not endure to have them go begging about the Church: therefore ſometimes would he riſe from his <hi>Chair</hi> where he took Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and make them wait at the Church-doors: as likewiſe he was very carefull there ſhould be no noiſe to hinder the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, or diſturb that ſilence that ought to be in the <hi>Church.</hi>

                        <p>Again if he knew of any one unjuſtly impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he never left mediating for him, till he were releaſed.

A Prieſt falſly impeached of heinous crimes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he knew him innocent; was through his means alſo delivered from the malice of his enemies.

                        <p>He was exceeding charitable to <hi>poor Prieſts,</hi> and eſpecially if they were <hi>forreigners.</hi> In the <hi>year</hi> 1551, there being a great dearth at <hi>Rome, Philip</hi> had ſix <hi>loaves</hi> brought him, which he immediately carried to a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that was a ſtranger, living himſelf on a few <hi>Olives:</hi> and being demanded why he kept ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a loaf for himſelf, replyed, <hi>Becauſe I am better known here than</hi> he, <hi>and can ſhift better then a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He found out divers wayes of helping <hi>Mechanicks</hi> and <hi>Artizans,</hi> ſuch as earned their living by <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all trades,</hi> and could neither put of their work nor get employment. There were two Brothers, <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> very expert <hi>Watch-makers,</hi> but grown old and having a great <hi>charge</hi> of Daughters that were marriagable, for whom they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114712:79"/> Husbands: the <hi>Good man</hi> perſwades ſome friends of his who were well-money'd men to buy thoſe <hi>Watches,</hi> by which means the Maids had fair Portions raiſed. This a certain man, one wiſe for himſelf, had obſerved, and ſeeing a wealthy perſon buy ſuch ſtore of <hi>Watches</hi> upon <hi>Philips</hi> perſwaſions, muttered privately, <hi>what means this waſte?</hi> but finding afterward that by theſe ſleights <hi>Philip</hi> as it were beguiled the Rich to maintaine the Poor, he was no more Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but thence-forward highly reverenced the B. <hi>man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One time one of thoſe that cry <hi>Succory</hi> about the City came to S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and being very wet weather, ſo that it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now toward night, the poor man could not go about the ſtreets to ſell his hearbs; the <hi>Father</hi> out of pity, that he might not go home ſad, bought ſome of his Succory, wiſhing them that ſtood by to do the like, and ſo ſent away the man joyfull and glad with his money in his purſe.</p>
                        <p>This his tender-heartedneſs and compaſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not only to reaſonable creatures, but even brute beaſts. One of <hi>his</hi> trod on a <hi>Lizard</hi> once, at which ſaid he, <hi>O thou hard-hearted Wretch! what harm did that poor creature do thee?</hi> Seeing a <hi>Butcher</hi> wound a Dog with his axe, he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his head moved with compaſſion, and cryed, <hi>O thou Barbarous creature!</hi> One of his <hi>Scholars</hi> brought him a <hi>Bird</hi> to delight him with the fight and ſinging of her: but he reſtored her to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where ſhe was bred. When he took <hi>Coach</hi> he would charge the <hi>Coachman</hi> to hurt no living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he drave on the way: and if any were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him, he would not let them be killed, but

                        <p>This his goodneſs and pity even the dumb crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures through the diſpoſall of <hi>Providence</hi> requited with manifold tokens as it were of gratitude again. <hi>Aloyſius Ames</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> preſented <hi>Philip</hi> with <hi>two</hi> fine <hi>ſinging birds</hi> which he accepted, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the donor would every day bring their food: the <hi>Good man</hi> deſiring by this means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract further familiarity with him.

                        <p>For proof whereof, beſides the undoubted pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Teſtimony of <hi>Cardinall Baronius,</hi> to whom the <hi>H.

                        <p>This pretious treaſure he hid cloſe under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of profound <hi>humility,</hi> guarding it every way by a moſt ſtrict <hi>watch</hi> kept over all his <hi>Senſes.</hi> For in imitation of that <hi>Great Antony,</hi> he never let any part of his body be ſeen <hi>naked:</hi> nor ever let fall a word that ſavoured of the leaſt immodeſty. He <hi>turned away his eyes from beholding vanity,</hi> inſomuch that a beautiful woman, whoſe <hi>Confeſſions</hi> he took for 30 years together, affirmed, he never ſo much as once
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114712:80"/> looked her in the face. At firſt when he was <hi>Confeſſor</hi> he alwayes looked ſowre while he ſpake to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not giving them ſo much as a coutteous word, though in his latter years he forbore that cuſtome.</p>
                        <p>Such and ſo purely white and unblemiſhed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity did the impure Fiend labour by all means to defile. One night forced by neceſſity, whilſt yet a <hi>Laique,</hi> he lodged at a friends of his, where the Daughter of the houſe, one of a fair body, but moſt deformed Soul, watching a fit occaſion came into the Chamber where the <hi>H. young man</hi> lay: thinking by that privacy to entice him to folly, but he Divinely aſſiſted repulſed her impudent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, going away victor over the unclean Spirit.</p>
                        <p>About the ſame time certain debauched perſons, not believing his Chaſtity to be ſuch as the rumor bruted, ſent for him on pretenſions of piety, and getting him into a private room, where <hi>two</hi> lewd women were provided to entrap him, locked the door upon him: but he betaking him to his <hi>main Fort,</hi> his Prayers, expreſſed himſelf therein with ſuch devotion and zeal, that they durſt neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near, nor ſo much as once ſpeak to him.</p>
                        <p>Being after made <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and appointed to take <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> he was more craftily aſſayed, as it were by <hi>Ambuſcado.</hi> For a notorious Strumpet, called <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi> hearing of his renowned Continency, and being her ſelf very handſome, proclaims, ſhe would effect her will on him; ſo pretending a deſperate ſickneſs ſhe ſends for <hi>Philip,</hi> as to take her <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> He at firſt refuſeth, fearing to bring a ſcandal on himſelf: for not without cauſe, being of thoſe years, he alwayes denyed to come to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but upon very much importunity, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly longing after the good of Souls, he went;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114712:81"/> when no ſooner was he entred within the doors, but the audacious harlot meets him with a tranſparent <hi>Veil</hi> caſt over her naked body: he perceiving the ſubtil wiles of the Devil, croſſing himſelf turns his back on her, and leaping down ſtaires breaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. She finding her ſelf cozen'd of her expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, takes a <hi>stool</hi> up and throws after him with all her might to hit him, but in vain: ſo the <hi>Servant</hi> of Chriſt by Gods providence eſcaped the danger both of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This reſolution of his for preſerving his Chaſtity God ſo rewarded, that he never after felt himſelf annoyed with <hi>inclinations</hi> to Luſt, or illuſions of the night. Inſomuch as he told <hi>Baronius</hi> once: <hi>Be aſſured</hi> Caeſar, <hi>if any ſuch thing ſhould befall me, though aſleep, I ſhould even dye for grief.</hi> Yea he had brought himſelf to that paſs, that as though he had been made of <hi>wood</hi> or <hi>ſtone,</hi> his body was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſenſleſs. And <hi>Gallonius</hi> ſpeaking of his rare <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence</hi> writes thus. <q>I do really believe (for he was intimate with the H. <hi>man) Philips</hi> Virginity and Purity was no whit inferiour to that which by ſpeciall priviledg from God was confered on <hi>Eleazar Count</hi> of <hi>Arian,</hi> and <hi>Simon Salo,</hi> whoſe Praiſes are recounted by the <hi>Metaphraſt</hi> in <hi>Surius</hi> for either of <hi>theſe</hi> led the lives of <hi>Angels</hi> amidſt the Society of Men.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover wonderfull were the effects of his his unſtained Chaſtity, For <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a Purity ſparkled forth at his very eyes, which from his <hi>Infancy</hi> to an extream <hi>Old age</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued quick and lively; ſo that one could ſcarce look ſteadily on him, nor was the moſt exquiſite Painter able to <hi>pourtray</hi> their glittering beauty.</p>
                        <p>As alſo his unpolluted Body caſt forth ſo ſweet a

                        </p>
                        <p>Yea this <hi>Maiden-man</hi> was ſo far favoured by God that he could by the <hi>ſmell</hi> diſtinguiſh who had kept their virginity, and who not. Therefore if any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious woman met him as he went, though ſhe were a ſtranger to him, he ſmelling a ſtink preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either put a <hi>handkerchief</hi> to his <hi>Noſe,</hi> or held <hi>it</hi> with his hand, ſaying that <hi>Nothing ſmelt more odious or noiſome than uncleanneſs. He</hi> would ſay to his <hi>Penitents</hi> that came to him polluted with this <hi>filthy ſin; Thou ſtinkeſt,</hi> Son, <hi>thou ſtinkeſt:</hi> ſo that they who knew it durſt not come to him, whilſt they ſtood defiled with ſuch impurities. Nay by the very look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>viſage</hi> he diſcovered the <hi>vice;</hi> a thing ſo common with him, that even in <hi>beaſts,</hi> that are without all fault herein, he could diſcern the like rankneſs.</p>

                        <p>A certain young man, out of an aim to be rich, and get a reputation in the City, applied himſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Civil Law;</hi> him the <hi>H. man</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>accoſt</hi> and extoll, ſaying, <hi>O happy you! you ſtudy hard now, and within a while will proceed</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>after which by your</hi> Law practiſe <hi>will gain a Maſs of Money, encreaſing both the wealth and honour of your Houſe, and who is there but expects you to mount to the Higheſt and moſt eminent dignities? O what a happy man are you! and then being made a great man you will ſcorn to look upon me a mean</hi> ſhrub.

Therefore as ſoon as they were allowed to hear <hi>Confeſſions</hi> he warned them eſpecially to receive no money from ſuch as came to them, oft uſing to ſay; <hi>If ye aim at the good of Souls, never ſeek the gold in their purſe:</hi> and frequently repeating that of the <hi>Apoſtles; Non veſtra, ſed vos.

As to that, that the <hi>Pope</hi> never viſited you, he retorts it upon you, who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it at his hands, having ſo often refuſed him the acceptance of a <hi>Cardinals Hat</hi> when freely tendred you. For the commands you lay upon
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114712:89"/> him, he gives you leave, if the <hi>Nuns</hi> oppoſe, to check them according to your accuſtomed juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: and he commands you to have a care of your health and not to take any more <hi>Confeſſions</hi> without his <hi>Permiſſion.</hi> And that when Chriſt ſhall come to you next, you remember to pray for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and for the urgent neceſſities of all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                           </q> Thus <hi>Clement.</hi> Whereby appears evidently that <hi>Philip</hi> had oft avoided the dignity of the <hi>Purple.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the ſame purpoſe was that which fell out ſome <hi>three</hi> moneths before the <hi>Servant of</hi> Chriſt died; when ſpeaking to <hi>Bernardine Corona,</hi> one of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> with whom <hi>Philip</hi> was familiarly and frequently converſant; <hi>The Pope</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will make me one of his Cardinals, what think you on't?</hi> He replied; <hi>You muſt needs accept of it, if it be but for the good you may do for the</hi> Congregation.

                        <p>Not without cauſe therefore did <hi>Marc. Antonius Maffa</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> utter theſe words: <q>It may be ſaid of <hi>Philip,</hi> as <hi>S. Hierom</hi> doth of <hi>Hilarion:</hi> Let others admire the wonders he did, his incredible abſtinence, learning, and humility; I admire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as that he ſhould ſo nobly ſpurn reputation and fame; eſpeciall ſeeing <hi>Philip</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the City, and in the <hi>throng</hi> of honours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſcorned honour.</q> So <hi>Maffa.</hi>

                        <p> But the <hi>Right humble man</hi> rejected not only the preferments offered him by ſuch as were <hi>Strangers;</hi> but even thoſe honours preſented by <hi>his own,</hi> as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Congregation.</hi> Inſomuch as being choſen <hi>perpetuall ſuperiour, two</hi> years before his death, he was extreamly importunate that they would let him lay down the Office, but they ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſing it, he by aſſiſtance of the <hi>Cardinalls Borromeo</hi> and <hi>Cuſanus</hi> procured of <hi>Pope Clement VIII.</hi> that the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſhould condeſcend to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty. So on the <hi>twenty third</hi> of <hi>July</hi> in the year <hi>One thouſand five hundred ninety three, Caeſar Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſucceeding him, did this vowed <hi>Lover</hi> of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> to the great joy of his heart, reſign his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour-ſhip.</hi> Yet neither did his abate any thing of their duty and obſervance toward him, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain did he in the leaſt withdraw, ſo much as for a minute, his care and providence for the benefit of the <hi>Congregation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as he demeaned himſelf herein, ſo would he have all his to behave themſelves; thoſe peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed when any adventured but to ſtep into the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> except only in caſes of neceſſity: ſo that he oftimes ſeverely reprehended <hi>Germanicus Fidelius</hi> for frequenting ſo much company of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> ſaying to him, <hi>

                        <p> Beſides the <hi>Servant of Chriſt</hi> would not willingly ſuffer any of <hi>his</hi> to hold above one <hi>Eccleſiasticall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice;</hi> and on no terms would take the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of ſuch <hi>Prelates,</hi> as, contemning the <hi>Refidence</hi> due unto their <hi>Sees,</hi> without colour of <hi>Canonicall</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, lived in the City; a thing wherein he would not diſpence with <hi>Cardinalls</hi> themſelves.</p>

                           <hi>man</hi> hoping by this means through the <hi>prayers</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to obtain what he leaſt expected from his own.</p>
                        <p>He alſo took it ill that any accounted him a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or holy man: and if he heard himſelf called <hi>Saint</hi> he would ſay; <hi>wretched I! how many rude Clowns, how many ſilly wenches ſhall go to heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me?</hi> One of his telling how he was held a <hi>Saint</hi> by all, he cried out <hi>Alas, Alas!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was alwayes averſe to eſtimation among men: for when being young the <hi>Armes</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were brought him, as a memoriall of his <hi>family,</hi> he preſently tore them. A little before he died he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>his papers</hi> to be burnt. He would ſuffer none, were they of never ſo mean quality, to <hi>ſtand bare</hi> to him. Nor would he ordinarily let any kiſs his <hi>hands,</hi> although he permitted ſome, that they might not go away ſad. He never uſed to diſcourſe with Spirituall men about Spirituall matters. He could not endure that any of the <hi>Congregation</hi> ſhould call him <hi>Superiour</hi> or <hi>Regent,</hi> but took much delight in the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Father:</hi> that <hi>name</hi> importing rather <hi>Affection</hi> than <hi>Authority.</hi> Hereupon being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Superiour</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> he was by <hi>his</hi> ſtill called <hi>Father.</hi> For this cauſe alſo he would not be ſtiled <hi>Founder</hi> or <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> of the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> profeſſing that he never intended the erecting a <hi>Congregation.</hi> He was far from all contention and emulation, abhorred complementing language and fine cloths. He extreamly diſliked ſome <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhions,</hi> but approved <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſimplicity ever in every one. He retained no familiarity with the diſſembling and worldly politique, and above all deeply deteſted <hi>Liars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In determining matters appertaining either to himſelf or the <hi>Congregation,</hi> he alwayes asked the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114712:92"/> opinion of others: adviſing not only with ſage and prudent perſons, but even thoſe of inferiour rank, deſirous they ſhould tell him plainly their opinion. He was much pleaſed when he heard himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued as a <hi>weak</hi> Perſon; remembring that of <hi>S. Paul, Si quis videtur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be wiſe, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe:</hi> ſo that of <hi>Philip</hi> it may be truly ſaid, as <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> of <hi>S. Ephrem; He had rather be, than ſeem holy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it hapned, that God did any thing ſupernaturall by him, he took ſuch care to conceal it, that none or very few came to know it: for as the B. <hi>Francis de Paula</hi> uſed herbs and the like in curing diſeaſes, thereby to diſguiſe the miracles he wrought; ſo <hi>Philip</hi> as it were <hi>jeſtingly</hi> uſed to do ſtrange effects; what he thus did ſeeming to the beholders quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing then indeed it was; in ſuch wiſe as divers believed that like another <hi>Simon</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Salo,</hi> he by his prayers obtained of God, that the many Miracles daily done by him ſhould paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned by the eys of lookers on.</p>
                        <p>Hereto belongs that he once told <hi>Baronius,</hi> when he commended him, though ſparingly and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Know</hi> Caeſar, <hi>that I am extreamly grieved, when I am in any eſteem with men, and therefore pray, that</hi> God <hi>would not ſuffer any thing at all whereby men may account me better then I am: ſince if he hath effected ought by me beyond the ordinary courſe of Nature, that is to be aſcribed unto the faith of others.</hi> Therefore being deſired on a time to lay his <hi>hands</hi> on the ſick for their recovery, he ſaid ſomthing angrily; <hi>Theſe people would certainly have me work miracles, which I am altogether unfit for.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In fine the <hi>Servant of</hi> Chriſt ſhone moſt glorious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114712:92"/> in his Chriſtian <hi>Humility</hi> toward all and on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, being gentle in commanding, moderate in tasking, pleaſant in behaviour, affable in <hi>converſe,</hi> at no time offenſive to any; as appeared in that he wore woollen ſocks in his Chamber, leſt he might diſturb them under him with his walking. So far from <hi>ſelf-conceit,</hi> that, as 'tis reported of <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas,</hi> he never in his life felt any provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>Vain glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He took all care poſſible, that his <hi>Sons</hi> likewiſe might aſcend the top of this Vertue: and as <hi>S. John the Evangeliſt</hi> oft inculcated thoſe words unto his <hi>Diſciples; Filioli diligite alterutrum; My little Children love one another;</hi> ſo did <hi>Philip</hi> often inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate this one thing ſtill; <hi>Humiles eſtote Filii, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles eſtote. Be humble, Sons, be humble.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>Tauruſius</hi> was preaching once, with ſuch <hi>zeal</hi> and vehemency that his Auditors applauded him, <hi>Philip</hi> on the ſudden ſteps forth, fearing the man might affect popularity, and falls to thumping the wall with his fiſt, till he drew the eyes of all upon him, by this means diverting <hi>Tauruſius</hi> from being puffed up with applauſe. Then going into the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi> cries out, <hi>There is no reaſon</hi> (ô ye Auditors) <hi>any of us ſhould boaſt, who as yet have not ſpilt the leaſt drop of bloud for the love of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>nay rather have gained much honour and eſtimation by being in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi> and enlarging thereon a while came down. <q>He ſaid, none ſhould mention his own praiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly either in earneſt or jeſt at any time. And that a man ſhould rejoyce, at leaſt not take it ill, if he did ought worthy commendation, though another had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the credit of it, foraſmuch as he ſhould be a double gainer thereby; to wit, for the <hi>work,</hi> and the <hi>Humility.</hi> He alſo adviſed <hi>his,</hi>
                              <pb n="166" facs="tcp:114712:93"/> to beg earneſtly of God, if he beſtowed on them any <hi>Vertue,</hi> not to diſcover it unto them; leſt they took occaſion of growing proud thereby; oft repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe words; <hi>Secretum meum mihi, &amp;c. My ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to my ſelf, my ſecret to my ſelf.</hi> Withall he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was a token of apparent danger willfully to incurr a danger: and therefore wiſhed <hi>his</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſay, <hi>Truſt not unto me</hi> Lord, <hi>for except thou help, doubtleſs</hi> I <hi>ſhall fall.</hi> He forbade them to vaunt of themſelves at any time, ſaying, <hi>If I were tempted this would I do or ſay;</hi> but rather, <hi>What is to be done,</hi> I <hi>know, what ſaid, but what I ſhould ſay, or do, I know not.</hi> In generall he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled <hi>Penitents,</hi> at the very entrance upon their confeſſion to diſcloſe their fouleſt crimes: ſaying this was <hi>the way to ſhame the devill:</hi> but he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly faulted the <hi>mincing</hi> a ſin, and transferring the blame upon others: adding, that he who meant to reach the higheſt degree of ſanctity, muſt never ſtand to excuſe himſelf, ſave in caſes excepted by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> calling them <hi>Eves</hi> who ſtil I excuſed themſelves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faulty in every thing. He further affirmed, the beſt courſe to keep one from ſin, was to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all haughtineſs of mind: again, he that is reproved for a fault, ſhould not be too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted at it: for, faid he, it oft falls out that <hi>the grief is more blame worthy, then the offence it ſelf, inſomuch as ſuch exceſſive ſorrow moſt commonly proceeds from nothing but Pride.</hi> Therefore if one had offended, he wiſhed him to upbraide himſelf thus; <hi>Had</hi> I <hi>been humble, ſurely I had not ſinned:</hi> but he neither readily nor generally liked their opinion, who over-confident of their own ſtrength deſired to be afflicted by God, whom he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114712:93"/> willed rather to beg <hi>Patience.</hi> Nothing was more perillous, he ſaid, then to carry themſelves like <hi>Maſters</hi> in their ſpirituall <hi>Apprentiſeſhip.</hi> That divine conſolations were to be expected in the privacy of the Cloſet, not in the ſociety of men: that a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>ſingularity</hi> was eſpecially to be avoided: and good works were at no hand to be omited for the ſuſpition of <hi>Vain glory.</hi> Therefore conſonant to the Doctrine of the <hi>H. Fathers,</hi> he divided <hi>vain glory</hi> briefly into three heads. The <hi>firſt</hi> he termed the <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> namely that which not only precedes a good work, but likewiſe diſpoſeth that Action to a vain end: the <hi>ſecond</hi> he named the <hi>Aſſociate,</hi> for that it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the deed, not without a kind of fond complacency: the <hi>third</hi> the <hi>Maid;</hi> when a man hath temptations to <hi>vain glory</hi> but extinguiſhes or abates them preſently: hereupon he bad them <hi>Take heed that vain glory become not your Miſtreſs.</hi>

                        <p>TO the vertue of <hi>Humility</hi> he added <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> wherein he ſo tranſcended, exerciſing both himſelf and <hi>his</hi> therewith, that juſtly he was reputed the <hi>Great Master</hi> of this <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For himſelf; his whole ſtudy and endeavour was to be diſeſteemed and vilified of all; for which cauſe he uſed to <hi>do,</hi> and many times put others upon the doing of, ſuch things as carried with them a ſemblance of a <hi>fickle</hi> or rather <hi>frantique</hi> mind.</p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:114712:94"/>
                        <p> In the firſt place therefore he was moſt vigilant in depreſſing all haughtineſs and exaltation of mind, as far as he might and could, both publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and privately, at home and abroad. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend methodically to ſome particulars. He would ſometimes dance with much eagerneſs, and that not in corners, but open Courts, in Porches, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, Streets, Market-places, and where the thickeſt crowds of people were gathered together; in the preſence of <hi>Princes, Prelats,</hi> and <hi>Cardinalls.</hi> Inſomuch that he was ſeen dancing publikely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all on the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>August</hi> in the ſtreet of S. <hi>Peter ad Vincula,</hi> where the whole City was ſolemnly convened, and when one of the ſpectators cried out, <hi>away old fool,</hi> he rejoyced extreamly, dancing and leaping ſo much the more for very gladneſs.</p>
                        <p>One time going about his occaſions he hapned on a man that ſold water in the City, whoſe beaſt being laden with veſſels, as the manner is, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, <hi>Prythee friend, let me drink a draught of water out of your Tub.</hi> He conſented; <hi>So Philip</hi> ſetting his mouth to the <hi>Barrel</hi> drank what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the ſtanders by gazing on him, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at him.</p>
                        <p>Meeting by chance the <hi>B. Felix</hi> of <hi>Cantalicium</hi> a <hi>Capuchin</hi> in the Street called the <hi>Bank,</hi> then full of people, ſaluting each other, he asked him, <hi>if he were athirſt?</hi> who anſwered, <hi>Indeed I am. Felix</hi> replied, <hi>Now will I try whether you have truly learnt the habit of Mortification:</hi> and ſtraight reached him the <hi>bottle</hi> that hung at his back, bidding him, <hi>Take it and drink: Philip</hi> took it and drank, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude looking on, and ſaying, <hi>Look yee one Saint drinks to the other. But now,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philip, I will ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have this vertue too, or not:</hi> when pulling his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114712:94"/> Cap off, he put it on his head, <hi>and bad him Go. See, I do</hi> replied the other, <hi>but if any body take away your Cap, look you to that, the loſs ſhall be yours.</hi> So <hi>Felix</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away with the cap, <hi>Philip</hi> ſoon diſpatched one after him to fetch it back. Which done, each went his way; the beholders being in ſuſpenſe whether of them had ſhewen greater ſelf-denyall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cardinall Alphonſus Jeſualdus</hi> preſented him with a coat of <hi>Sables</hi> conditioning that he ſhould wear it, <hi>Philip</hi> promiſed him, and wore it a full moneth within doors and without, ſtalking with a ſtately gate as being brave and gallant, on purpoſe to be derided, looking firſt on this ſide then on that, as one proud of his attire, till taken for a frantique he was laughed at by all.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Pius</hi> V. of <hi>B. Memory,</hi> had invited <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>dinner:</hi> who boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Lentills firſt, put them in a pot, and gave one of his to carry to the Feaſt with him, for trial of their <hi>mortification:</hi> as they were all ſet, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the pot to be placed in the midſt of all their dainties; himſelf taſts it firſt, then invites the reſt, and diſtributes it; that neither the <hi>Cardinall</hi> nor the Company, knowing the holineſs of the man, could refuſe his proffer, but all fed very heartily on it.</p>
                        <p>The day that the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>H. Martyrs Papias</hi> and <hi>Maurus</hi> were tranſlated to the Church of <hi>Valli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella,</hi> both Streets and Church thronged with the concourſe of people, <hi>Philip</hi> attending the coming of the ſacred <hi>Reliques</hi> nigh the gate, falls to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing with a <hi>Switzer,</hi> a Souldier belonging to the <hi>Popes</hi> Guard, pulling him by his large broad <hi>beard,</hi> they that ſaw it partly wondring, partly laughing thereat.</p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:114712:95"/>
                        <p> Another time to expoſe himſelf the more to ſcorn, he made half his <hi>beard</hi> be ſhaven of, and going immediately into the Sreet began to dance and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as his guiſe was, very pleaſantly, that ſo like another <hi>David, becoming more Vile</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he might erect the <hi>Trophees</hi> of victory gotten over himſelf.

                        <p>The <hi>Humble man</hi> likewiſe went often thorow the City with a huge <hi>traine</hi> of Diſciples accompanying him, carrying a large <hi>poſy</hi> of <hi>flowers</hi> in his hand, and ſometimes without his Cloak, by this means attracting the eyes of all unto him, that he might be ſcorned as an <hi>Idiot</hi> or <hi>Natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At home he was ever contriving wayes ſtill to make himſelf contemptible; of which among ſeverall others that occurr, the <hi>Reader</hi> may take theſe few examples. In the firſt place, you ſhould ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſeen him, when he was private in his Chamber, with a <hi>Crimſon ſhirt</hi> on reaching to his knee, huge big <hi>ſhoes,</hi> and thoſe <hi>white</hi> too, upon his feet, a ſtraight <hi>Cap</hi> on his head; in which <hi>Dreſs</hi> he would entertain <hi>Noble</hi> Perſonages, and men of quality, to make himſelf hereby ridiculous unto them. Yea he would ſometimes go to Church in this habit, and that upon Feſtivall dayes. It once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114712:95"/> that he came abroad thus attired, on the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary</hi> of the <hi>B.

                        </p>
                        <p>For the ſame reaſon he had by him <hi>Romances</hi> and books fraught with fables, that he might be taxed for his levity and vanity; and when either Noble, Sage, or Learned Perſons reſorted to him, he would make one of <hi>his</hi> read them; ſhewing both by looks and geſture that he was exceedingly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith.</p>
                        <p>Once <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. ſent ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of the Kingdome of <hi>Poland</hi> to him, that they might behold an example of Vertue for their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and by his converſation and conference in things ſpirituall might alſo conceive a due eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his great ſanctity: He having notice of it aforehand, that they were a coming, calls one of his <hi>Sons</hi> to read him one of thoſe books, and not leave, till he bad him. Anon they came, when without ceremony or reſpect he tells them; <hi>I would have you hearken till this Tale be ended:</hi> to which they willingly yielding; <hi>Mark ye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether I be not choyce to have books of a grave ſubject read to me;</hi> without mentioning one word of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maters. So having tarried a while, looking one upon another, and wondring at what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſaid nothing but went their wayes; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> bidding his <hi>Scholar; lay away the book now, for I have done what I would with it.</hi>

                        <p> An honourable <hi>Roman</hi> going once with the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician Angelus Victorius</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> obſerved him ſomwhat too ſportive and light in his behaviour, and wondring one ſo highly reputed ſhould demean himſelf ſo vainly, at his departure told the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; Your Old Man (my</hi> Angelus) <hi>hath, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, not a little offended me.

                        <p>When he went from S. <hi>Hieroms to Vallicella,</hi> he left a <hi>Cat</hi> there, and for <hi>ſix</hi> whole years he every day ſent one of his <hi>Sons</hi> morning and evening to give her meat, and when they came back, would ask them before all, even <hi>Nobles</hi> and others, how the <hi>Cat</hi> did, whether ſhe did eat and reſt well, or no; as though it had beeen a matter of huge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                        <p>Once in the heat of <hi>Summer</hi> he was ſeen openly in the Church clad in a furr'd Coat; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put off, he dreſſed up one of his <hi>Sons</hi> in, with the wrong ſide outward, and ſends him on an <hi>errand</hi> ſo to <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> as they were ſinging <hi>Veſpers:</hi> the young man aſhamed to go in ſuch a habit skulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privily behind the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſeats and delivered his meſſage. <hi>Philip</hi> who at a diſtance ſaw the carriage of the buſineſs, as ſoon as he returned ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, bidding him go thorow the midſt of the <hi>Quire;</hi> he obſerved his commands though much againſt his will.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, as one that could dive into the in moſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes</hi> of the Soul, he uſed, for the ſubduing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, to enjoyn them (though ſeldom) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to diſcloſe the ſecrets and cogitations of their hearts. Which ſpeciall <hi>Antidote</hi> he made uſe of for reducing troubled and oppreſſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to a tranquility and calme. One of <hi>his</hi> had entertained ſome thoughts againſt <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, which the <hi>R.

But this courſe he took with none, but ſuch as he found very tractable and obedient. A <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> who before his entrance into that Religious order, was aſſailed with violent and ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations having this one remedy of <hi>Philip,</hi> but to make known his grief, was cured in his mind of all thoſe perturbations.</p>
                        <p>But foraſmuch as <hi>Philip</hi> mainly exacted of all <hi>his,</hi> that they ſhould ſubmit the internall motions of their Underſtandings and Wills to the direction of another, it will not be amiſs to recount here that which befell <hi>Baronius</hi> to this purpoſe.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114712:99"/> was much troubled at it, eſpecially not having wherewith to diſcharge the <hi>Tranſcribers</hi> of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican Records.</hi> Therefore he alledged many and ſeverall Arguments to alter the <hi>Fathers</hi> intention; but he being peremptory and reſolved on it, could by nothing that was propounded be brought off, whereat <hi>Baronius</hi> began to be much dejected. So ſending for <hi>Thomas Bozzius</hi> he entreats him to deal with the <hi>Father</hi> effectually and to change his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, proteſting that he would rather leave the <hi>Congregation,</hi> then bear that charge. <hi>Bozzius</hi> gratifies him herein, but finds <hi>Philip</hi> more reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than before, requiring him in plain terms, <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pay or to be gone, for</hi> God <hi>needs not the help of men.</hi> At that, <hi>Thomas</hi> counſelled <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and earneſtly beſought him to yield himſelf up in every thing to the commands of the <hi>B. Father;</hi> remembring that next under God he was indebted unto him both for his Spirituall and Secular knowledg. At length he, following his good counſell, repairs ſpeedily to the <hi>H. man,</hi> and falling down at his feet in moſt humble manner begs his pardon, offering not his money alone, but himſelf, and all he had to his ſervice chearfully. To whom <hi>Philip; Had you but done your Duty we needed not your money: only learn hence-forward to yield more ready obedience, and ſoften the hardneſs of your refractary mind.</hi> For his greateſt deſire was, that <hi>his</hi> ſhould enure themſelves to ſuppreſs the too nice inquiſitions of the <hi>Intellect</hi> which he called the <hi>Rationale:</hi> and therefore he ſaid, <hi>All vertue was comprized within the compaſs of</hi> three <hi>fingers;</hi> putting his hand upon his <hi>forehead</hi> while he ſpake ſo, and adding, <hi>This is the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Spirituall life, to lay aſide Reaſon and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings.</hi>

                        <p> And withall he diligently trained up his Sons in the daily and conſtant practiſes of Mortification. For many times when one of them was a preaching, he would command another to go up into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and bid him hold his peace: ſometimes he made them ſpeak <hi>ex tempore</hi> to the people, who at his command did much better on the <hi>ſudden,</hi> than if they had premeditated. Otherwhiles he would ſend them to the <hi>Booksellers,</hi> bidding them ask <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud</hi> for the <hi>Jeſts of Plebanus Arlottus,</hi> or the <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Mathew Boiardus,</hi> or if they had <hi>Eſops Fables</hi> to ſell. He made them more than once go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward from <hi>Vallicella</hi> to S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> without a Cloak, or elſe in torne and ragged cloths: whereupon it once fell out, that one of his wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his appointment tattered <hi>Sleeves,</hi> met one that offered him a newer pair, which he refuſed, <hi>Philip</hi> hearing thereof preſently diſpatches him to the man, to tell him, how he denyed to take them then, as not lacking them, but would willingly now accept them, for that he needed them: the <hi>Scholar</hi> did ſo, and having gotten the <hi>ſleeves</hi> wore them till they were all to pieces.

                        <p>But ſome out of ſpleen, having an <hi>evill eye</hi> at the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> watched all occaſions to defame and and aſperſe him, under colour of pretended Piety and Religion. It hapned that one, <hi>Philip</hi> living at S. <hi>Hieroms,</hi> in <hi>Service,</hi> was for his Society with a woman clapt up in priſon by the <hi>Seriants,</hi> whereupon his Enemies gave out in the City that <hi>F.

                        <p>He went to a <hi>Prelate</hi> one time, to mediate for a <hi>Noble Roman</hi> that lay in durance, unjuſtly charged with a <hi>Capitall crime.</hi> He not only refuſed to hear the truth, but ſo deſpitefully reviled the <hi>Servant of God,</hi> that they who were by could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the <hi>malice</hi> of the one, and meekneſs of the

There was at S. <hi>Johns</hi> Church of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> a Servant of ſome <hi>Noblemans,</hi> who on a ſudden, without any cauſe offered, began with ſo much <hi>impotency</hi> to rail at <hi>Philip,</hi> that a <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>S.

                        <p>Yea the <hi>Servant of</hi> God was not only affronted by ſtrangers, but even thoſe to whom he had done favours.

                        <p>A certain <hi>Prelate,</hi> whoſe name for modeſties ſake is omitted, had moſt fouly accuſed <hi>Philip</hi> to one of the <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> to the intent, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being publikely taken notice of, the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi> might be utterly ruined: and ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous were the <hi>imputations,</hi> that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> made the <hi>Pope</hi> acquainted with them.

In the mean time it hapned that the <hi>Monks</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> impeached that <hi>Prelate</hi> of Apoſtatizing from their <hi>Order,</hi> which he took ſo to heart, that for very grief he fell ſick, and in ſhort ſpace deceaſed. Yet <hi>Philip</hi> forgetting all injuries viſited him much in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114712:102"/> and hearing of his death lamented, bidding the <hi>H. Bible</hi> ſhould be brought him, and preſently opening the Book light upon thoſe words in the <hi>Proverbs: Homo Apostata vir inutilis</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding perſon, a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth, he winketh with his eyes, he ſpeaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers, frowardneſs is in his heart, he deviſeth miſchief continually, he ſoweth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; therefore ſhall his deſtruction come ſuddenly, ſuddenly ſhall he be broken without remedy.</hi> To men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion others, who perſecuting the B. <hi>man</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly felt Gods revenging hand, is not thought convenient, in regard it may diſtaſt Poſterity, and is therefore omitted.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed in the relation of <hi>Philips</hi> Patience: this <hi>Vertue</hi> had taken ſo deep rooting in his mind, that he not only quietly ſuſtained injuries, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven loved his Adverſaries with all his heart, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt fervently to God for them. Beſides he was of ſo ſweet and affable a nature, that he was never known to be angry in good earneſt, except againſt notorious <hi>debauchery,</hi> and the habits of <hi>Vice:</hi> for albeit he carryed a ſtern countenance toward his <hi>Scholars,</hi> the better to further their progreſs in piety, yet as ſoon as he, whom he had chidden, had but turned his back, the <hi>meek-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man</hi> cleared up again and looked as cheerfull a sever. He checked <hi>Ant. Gallonius</hi> ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, and perceiving him troubled at it, coming nearer him, pleaſantly ſaid to him, <hi>Give me a kiſs,</hi> Antony, <hi>for ſo it is my will and pleaſure:</hi> which the <hi>Good old man</hi> did, to remove from his mind all ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grief. He never looked ſad; nay his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent company pleaſed all: he was of ſo ſetled and untroubled a mind, that his <hi>Sons</hi> would ſay:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114712:103"/> 
                           <hi>Do what wrong ſo ever to Father</hi> Philip <hi>it never moves nor diſquiets him a jot.</hi> When it was told him, how ſome called him an <hi>Old bearded Dotard,</hi> he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even <hi>capered</hi> for joy. Another time hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one inveigh againſt the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> as he preached, he ſhewed not the leaſt ſign of diſlike thereat.</p>
                        <p>His Meekneſs and Patience appeared alſo in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining infirmities and indiſpoſitions of Body; for being often ſick, and that for no little while, but ſometimes <hi>fifty</hi> or <hi>threeſcore</hi> days together, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was <hi>four</hi> times anointed with the <hi>Sacred Oile,</hi> yet he alwayes ſhewed cheerfullneſs in his looks without any diſcovery of pain at all. So that once when the Doctors had given him quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and he perceived his <hi>Sons</hi> to be in great heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him, with a ſtout heart and loud voice he cried out, <hi>what is the matter</hi> Fathers, <hi>what is the matter, I ſay, that you are diſquieted ſo? Eqidem paratus ſum, &amp; non ſum turbatus; Truely I am Ready and not diſmayed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All the time that he was ſick, he never ſpoke of his diſeaſe to any but <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> He was never known to complain; though his malady grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet he ſcarce changed the <hi>tenor</hi> of his voice; ſuch as came to him he entertained with his wonted courteſy; rather adminiſtring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſuch as viſited him, than receiving rom them. He ever took the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> except he were prohibited expreſly by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. If his <hi>Sons</hi> at any time wiſhed him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear for a time, for his healths ſake, his anſwer was; <hi>Let me alone, nothing is more pleaſing to me than to hear confeſſions.</hi> It was aſcribed to a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle alſo, that being on the ſudden freed from his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114712:103"/> diſeaſe he returned immediately to his charge; lying ſick almoſt to death, as it might be <hi>to day,</hi> and <hi>to morrow</hi> betaking him more vigorouſly than before to the wonted offices of Religion. Which he attributing to a Divine hand, told the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> oft; <hi>Not you, but that ſame Box of</hi> H. Reliques (pointing to it with his finger) <hi>hath recovered me.</hi> They were given him by <hi>S. Carlo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> he was like to dye once, and being very thirſty modeſtly intreated <hi>Iulius Petruccius,</hi> a <hi>Nobleman</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> that was by, to give him a <hi>cup</hi> of <hi>water</hi> with <hi>juice</hi> of a <hi>Pomgranate</hi> in it. And as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was about to <hi>ſugar</hi> it, to abate the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> ſuddenly appeared a young man whom he had never ſeen before, or after, who offered him a lump of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and ſo vaniſhed. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> gives <hi>Philip</hi> the drink, who, having drunk it up and ſlept a while on one ſide of the <hi>Bed,</hi> awaked, and ſaid, I <hi>am well: Julius</hi> thinking of the <hi>Boy,</hi> and ſeeing none knew him, concluded it was an <hi>Angel</hi> ſent from heaven to take care of the <hi>H. man:</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the day following went about his Spirituall affairs in as perfect health as ever.</p>
                        <p>Another time he was ſick in the ſame Houſe, ſo that the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſaid there was no hopes of life, and they had newly given him the H. <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and prepared him by <hi>Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence; there was preſent <hi>Pet.

                        <p>
                           <q>To come at laſt to his <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> which he laid down.

                        <p>TO conclude at length this Argument of the <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Philip;</hi> He knowing, that no work be it never ſo laborious, never ſo laudable, unleſs it be conſummate and crowned with <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> may be rightly termed an <hi>act</hi> of compleat <hi>Vertue;</hi> reſolutely perſiſted in a conſtant and even tract of <hi>Piety</hi> to his End. So that as ſoon as he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and underſtood that he was called thither to Labour in the <hi>Lords</hi> Vineyard, for the ſpace of <hi>threeſcore Years,</hi> he went not ſo much as once with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>City walls,</hi> except out of devotion to viſit the <hi>Seven Churches.</hi> And though his friends often urged him to go to this or that place for his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially his <hi>kinred,</hi> that he would come to <hi>Florence;</hi> yet could he never be perſwaded to leave the City.</p>
                        <p>Being in obedience to his <hi>Superiors,</hi> made <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> he ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> every day, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the laſt heard <hi>Confeſſions.</hi> When the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> afterward was inſtituted, he would not take upon him any other charge but that, to the end he might more carefully and effectually intend the <hi>Services</hi> he had ſet up in it; nor did he introduce a multiplicity of Exerciſes in the <hi>Congregation;</hi> contenting himſelf with <hi>three</hi> principally, as he ſaid, to wit, <hi>Prayer, Adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> and the daily <hi>Repaſt</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of God.</p>
                        <p>He did ever and anon inculcate that <hi>leſſon</hi> to <hi>his; Non qui inceperit, ſed qui perſever averit uſque in finem, hic ſalvus erit. Not he that begins, but that endureth</hi>

                           <hi>unto the end, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <hi>them</hi> to ſo excellent a <hi>Vertue,</hi> he inſtilled into them that <hi>Golden Mean</hi> of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> ſaying; <q>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing muſt not be attempted in one day; nor all the Stages of Holineſs be <hi>poſted</hi> over in <hi>three:</hi> adding that it was a harder matter to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſuch as were too venturous, than to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the timorous or ſluggiſh: alſo, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall work was not ſo ſtrictly to be ſtood on, nor the means ſo eagerly to be purſued, as to forget the chief <hi>end</hi> and <hi>ſcope</hi> thereof. Again, that the body ſhould ſo far be kept low as that the Paſſions of the mind might not rebell. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirmed, that the exerciſes of Piety were not lightly to be omitted, whereto a man had formerly obliged himſelf; therefore thoſe that tasked themſelves with too many duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did not wiſely: for they who ſo over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened themſelves either deſiſted as being tired therewith, or diſpatched them too faſt. Therefore he wiſhed <hi>his</hi> to chuſe a moderate courſe for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters, which having once entred upon they ſhould never lay aſide: inaſmuch as the ſubtile <hi>Enemy</hi> of mankind, if once he can interrupt one duty of Piety, will not ſurceaſe his aſſaults, till he have deſtroyed all. Therefore he oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this document to his;</q>

                           <q>He exhorted them likewiſe to reinforce and ſtrengthen their reſolutions of Holineſs every day; never deſpairing under trialls, ſeeing God firſt ſuffers him, whom he intends to advance to eminency in any <hi>Vertue,</hi> to be aſſailed with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters from the opoſite <hi>Vice.</hi> He taught them, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of devotion was conferred plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114712:105"/> at the <hi>firſt,</hi> but afterward God made ſhew of withdrawing himſelf, that the Soul, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of celeſtiall conſolations, might learn to grow and feed on more ſolid meat. Moreover he ſaid there were <hi>three</hi> kinds of ſpitituall life. The <hi>firſt</hi> he called the <hi>Animall;</hi> wherein men are attracted with a certain <hi>ſenſible devotion</hi> as <hi>beaſts</hi> are by their <hi>fodder.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> he termed the <hi>Rationall;</hi> when without any allectives of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, men contend for vertue in continuall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> he intitled <hi>Angelicall;</hi> when the <hi>heat</hi> of Paſſion being allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they enjoyed a quiet <hi>ſerenity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in the contemplation of God.

                           <q>He counſelled young people to be as cautious of avoiding the ſociety of lewd Perſons, and of conſorting with the <hi>civill,</hi> as they would be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of receiving the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yet he truſted not much to young Perſons; for if he heard of any ſuch who were reputed in their youth very forward in the ways of <hi>God;</hi> he would ſtraight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; <hi>Let them be fledged firſt, before you judge of their flying.</hi>

                        <p>Thoſe who intended themſelves for a Religious Houſe he tried firſt with ſeverall ſorts of Penance; that they might better perſevere in their vowed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. Whereupon divers of them, which upon his approbation devoted themſelves to that courſe of life, have, when occaſion ſerved, avouched, that had not the <hi>H. man</hi> firſt proved and examined them thus, they ſhould not long have kept their <hi>Cloyster.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was always jealous of thoſe, whether <hi>Laicks</hi> or <hi>Regulars,</hi> that kept not their Stations, but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114712:106"/> ſhifted to <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> and then to a ſtricter kind of life: <hi>for the devill,</hi> quoth he, <hi>transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, labours under the falſe diſguiſes of a more perfect life to ſeduce men from the right path. Maximianus Burgus</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> was by a certain <hi>Lord</hi> entertained into his Houſe, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he ſhould not be put to <hi>ſome</hi> employments, that he might have the more leiſure to ſerve <hi>God.</hi> But the <hi>Nobleman</hi> breaking his word with him once or twice, <hi>Maximianus</hi> purpoſed to leave him; whom the <hi>B. man</hi> with many and ſeverall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perſwades to ſtay, telling him at laſt; <hi>If you run away from this croſs, you ſhall certainly fall into another worſe.</hi> And ſo it was; for when he went from his <hi>Lord</hi> he wandred up and down in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall unſettlement.</p>
                        <p>But though in generall he wiſhed to all this <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> yet did he more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to them of the <hi>Congregation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, he ſeldome ſuffered any of them to go out of the <hi>City:</hi> as may appeare by that which follows. A young man of a very good family was admitted into the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> he being of excellent parts had raiſed huge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of himſelf among all.

                           <hi>John Antonius Luccius,</hi> intending to go from <hi>Rome</hi> into his own Countrey, asked the <hi>H. mans</hi> conſent, who would by no means yeild to it, nay oppoſed it; uſing that of <hi>S.

Yet he went, and never afer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the <hi>Congregation.</hi> The ſame hapned in like manner to others, who going to their <hi>Countries</hi> without his likeing, either died there, or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the <hi>Congregation</hi> betook themſelves to ſome other courſe.</p>
                        <p>Nor could he willingly ſuffer them to go from the City ſo much as to found <hi>Congregations</hi> in the neighbouring Towns, or to ſettle ſuch as were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready erected: but by his good will would have them abide conſtantly at <hi>Rome.</hi> Which beſides that our <hi>Fathers</hi> do often inculcate this to the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi> of the Society, may be gathered from his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> writ to <hi>S.

                        <p>As he was at <hi>Maſs</hi> he was often in <hi>Raptures;</hi> as, beſides others who aver as much, <hi>Cardinall Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Paravicinus</hi> can teſtify: who attending on him when he was about <hi>Twenty years</hi> of age, was an <hi>eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs</hi> thereof.</p>
                        <p>When ever he addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Pope,</hi> fearing he might be ſurpriſed, whilſt he was with him, he would ſay to his Sons; <hi>Look, that during the time I am with his</hi> Holineſs, <hi>I commit nothing prepoſterous, or unbeſeeming ſuch a preſence.</hi>

And it coſt me a very great deal of harraſſing and toile to my ſelf, juſt ſo as if an ordinary perſon had been fighting with ſome ſtrong Giant; and afterward I ſhould find my ſelf very weary. But at othertimes it was altogether impoſſible for me to hinder it; for my Soul would be carried ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely away, and (ordinarily) even my head (as it were) after it; yea and this ſometimes ſo far, as that my whole body would be tranſported ſo, as to be raiſed up from the ground. This laſt hath hapned rarely to me; but once it was upon the very point to arrive, whilſt we all were aſſembled together in the Quire; and I being then upon my knees (and at the point of going to receive the bleſſed Sacrament) it put me to an extreamity of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it ſeemed to be a very extraordinary thing, &amp; that inſtantly there would be much notice taken of it, and ſo I commanded my religious women (for at that time I was Prioreſs) that they ſhould not ſpeak of it to any creature. But at other times when I began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that our Lord was going about to do the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (and once, in particular, when divers principall Ladyes were preſent; and it was upon the Feaſt of our Patron when there was a Sermon) I did even ſpread my ſelf all along upon the ground, and though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women came then about me, to keep my body down, yet the thing was eaſily perceived. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this I humbly prayed our Lord in moſt particular manner, that by no means he would do me any ſuch favours, as might carry any of theſe exterior demonſtrations with them; for already I was very weary of being continually ſo wary and watchfull over my ſelf: for that ſuch kind of favours could not poſſibly be done me by his Divine Majeſty, but ſo that every body would come to know it.</hi>

                        <p>As he was on a time at Church, a devill in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Boy</hi> came and mocked him, blowing his Noſe with a handkerchief; but <hi>Philip</hi> with a mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing countenance looking on him, put him to flight and ſhame. Then asking <hi>Gallonius,</hi> if he ſaw the <hi>Boy,</hi> he anſwered; <hi>yes, Know,</hi> quoth <hi>Philip, it was no Boy; but the Fiend, that came to tempt the faithfull who were at Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed the <hi>Envious ſpirit</hi> was ſo malicious againſt him, that he continually wrought him miſchief: appearing to him in hideous and ugly ſhapes; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fouling his apparell; otherwhiles removing huge Logges and Beams of timber to and fro; then putting out his Candle, and making a noiſe; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wait perpetually for him night and day.

                        <p>By theſe frequent apparitions, both from God and from the Devil unto him, it came to paſs, that as oft as he ſpake to his Sons of this Argument, he conſtantly aſſerted that <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Saints; <q>
                              <hi>That they were not things to be ſtood on.</hi> Neither could he by any means approve their ſpirit, that eagerly ſought after ſuch things; neither did he think it ſufficient, for one to ſay: <hi>I regard not Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114712:114"/> therefore ſuch as are illuſions ſhall not befall me: becauſe theſe many times hapned alſo to thoſe, who are no wayes deſirous of Viſions. That it was a hard matter, not to be puffed up with them; a harder, to count ones ſelf not worthy of them; but moſt difficult of all, to judg ones ſelf utterly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof, and not to prefer ſuch Viſions before Vertues and a ſolid piety.</hi> He ſaid likewiſe, thoſe Viſions were to be rejected, at leaſt, with much caution to be received, that neither profited the Church, nor ones ſelf, promoting neither the publick nor private good of others. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> that they ſhould make but light account of the Revelations of <hi>Penitents,</hi> of <hi>women</hi> eſpecially, for that women preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves at the <hi>top</hi> of perfection, but in proceſs of time you will find the <hi>Sanctity</hi> they pretend to, ſavours either of <hi>vanity</hi> or <hi>hypocriſy:</hi> and that many ſuch have fallen foully, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unhappily. Therefore going once into the <hi>Pulpit</hi> to preach, finding himſelf beginning to be in an <hi>Extaſy</hi> and labouring by all force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, he ſtrook his <hi>hand</hi> upon his <hi>thigh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that purſues after</hi> Viſions <hi>and</hi> Trances, <hi>knows not what he doeth:</hi> ſo burſting forth into teares he departed. Another time when a <hi>Scholar</hi> of his preached about ſome ſuch ſubject to the People, getting up into the <hi>Chair</hi> on the ſudden he began thus: <hi>I know a Religious woman, that had many Trances, at length by the</hi> Divine Providence <hi>ſo it was, ſhe never had any more.

Who being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to know, what courſe of life he ſhould lead, repaired to <hi>Philip,</hi> whoſe piety was much fam'd throughout the City; ſo kneeling down, to make a <hi>Generall Confeſſion,</hi> as they term it, of his ſins unto him, <hi>Philip</hi> takes the paper wherein he had marked down his faults, and tears it, which he patiently endured: and much admiring the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the man, ever after was directed and led by his conduct in all the actions of his life, as if he had been, as himſelf ſaid, a meer <hi>carkaſe:</hi> neither after made he any more words, concerning the <hi>Generall Confeſſion.</hi> Meanwhile he put up his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that what he pleaſed to appoint for him, <hi>Philip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> might diſcover to him: and lo! as he was in prayer at S. <hi>Bonaventures</hi> Church under <hi>Mount Quirinall,</hi> he heard a voice bidding him; <hi>John Baptiſt return to</hi> Fulginium, <hi>return to</hi> Fulgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. At the hearing of which, although he were wont to communicate all things unto the <hi>H. man,</hi> yet would he not preſently acquaint him with this, leſt he ſhould ſuſpect him to <hi>long</hi> after his Countrey. But <hi>Philip,</hi> who knew all by <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> ſaid to him: <hi>I command you, that you return into your own Countrey, for thither</hi> Chriſt <hi>calls you, yet be in a readineſs to come hither, whenſoever I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi> Whereupon he travells to his Native ſoile, where he made ſuch Progreſs in Holineſs and Vertue, that while he lived he was commonly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Saint.</hi>

                        <p>With no leſs advantage, both to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did he detain <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> among the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</hi> when having oft deſired <hi>Philips</hi> leave, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Order</hi> of Capuchins, he could never get
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:114712:137"/> his conſent; inſomuch as ſome hearing how the <hi>Father</hi> oppoſed it, and diverted him from it, not duly weighing things were ſcandalized thereat, that he ſhould diſcourage any from a <hi>Religious</hi> State. But the ſequell evidenced how much they were deceived, and how judicious his caution was: ſeeing every one knows how renowned for his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>learning Baronius</hi> was in his <hi>Secular</hi> courſe; and what incomparable ſervice he did the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> both by his Writings and Example.</p>
                        <p>He perſwaded <hi>Franc. Puccius</hi> of <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> to live a <hi>Secular</hi> too. For he contemning the ſpecious vanity and emptineſs of the World, was moſt paſſionately deſirous to become a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> ſo that he minded nothing elſe day nor night, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaw any of that <hi>Order,</hi> he thought him an <hi>Angel.</hi> So adviſing with <hi>Philip,</hi> he tells him what he had been deſigning; <hi>You,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip, are not fit for a</hi> Religious <hi>life; therefore live at</hi> Paleſtrina, <hi>where you are like to be moſt beneficiall. Puccias</hi> was not ſatisfyed with this, but wearied the <hi>Good man</hi> with continuall requeſts, to procure an anſwer to his mind. At laſt he bad him; <hi>Go, but withall know you ſhall not ſtay long among them.</hi> The young man poſts away to <hi>Viterbium,</hi> to accompliſh his deſires, but by the way fell ſo deſperately ill, that after a tedious languiſhing ſickneſs he was fain to return home again; where growing more reſolved, and ſuppoſing it ill done of him to return into his Countrey, he vowed if he recovered, he would aſſay once more to put himſelf into the <hi>Capuchins Order. So</hi> when he was well again, he comes to <hi>Philip,</hi> tells him, he had lately made a <hi>Vow;</hi> the <hi>H. man</hi> cries; <hi>God forgive you, did I not foretell you, that a</hi> Religious <hi>life would not ſuit with you?

The <hi>Generall</hi> asks him; <hi>what I pray,</hi> Good friend, <hi>have you vowed our courſe of life? I have ſo,</hi> quoth he. <hi>But,</hi> replyed the other, <hi>though you have ſworn our</hi> Rule, <hi>yet we have not ſworn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in, therefore go ſome whither elſe, for here is no room for you.</hi> At that <hi>Puccius</hi> was quiet, and returning to <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> being firſt made <hi>Prieſt,</hi> then <hi>Archprieſt</hi> of that City, performed ſuch, and ſo many ſervices tending to the good of <hi>Souls,</hi> both in his Country and at <hi>Latium,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Campania:</hi> that he was generally ſtiled the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> of thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>He prevailed likewiſe with a <hi>Noble</hi> young <hi>Roman,</hi> that came to ask his advice, about taking a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habit, to live quietly at home, ſaying, <hi>Some evill Spirit would amuſe you with theſe kind of thoughts that he may ruine you and your whole Family.

                        <p>Some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> had a deſire to have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Youth admitted into the <hi>Oratory, Philip</hi> was unwilling, yet, being deſirous to gratifie the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> permitted him; but a while after, the young man, out of a kinde of Levity, left the <hi>Houſe</hi> of his own accord.</p>
                        <p>There were two, whoſe Confeſſions the <hi>H. man</hi> uſed to hear, the one an <hi>Italian,</hi> the other a <hi>French man,</hi> but the <hi>Italian</hi> ſeemed the more devout. Of theſe <hi>Philip</hi>

                        <p>Another young man alſo came ſumptuouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> to hear the <hi>Sermons,</hi> not to gain benefit by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> but to <hi>jeer</hi> at the <hi>Preachers.</hi> Where one time he made ſuch a noiſe, that he diſturbed thoſe that were neer him; who not enduring his ſaucineſs and impudence, ſpake to <hi>Philip</hi> to reprove him.

So,</hi> when the young man came to underſtand himſelf, he entred into the ſtricteſt of the <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> where perſiſting in Holineſs, and abounding in Vertues he ended his dayes.</p>
                        <p>He had a certain <hi>Penitent</hi> a <hi>Portugues,</hi> about 17. years of age, who was well known to the <hi>Cardinall a Monte Politiano,</hi> one that had attained to ſuch a

But as he was putting on his <hi>Religious habit,</hi> the <hi>Servant</hi> of God being by went aſide a little, and turning to the Wall wept exceedingly. <hi>Tauruſins</hi> ſeeing it asked why he grieved; who anſwered, that <hi>he deplored the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of that young man. Tauruſius</hi> then knew not the meaning of thoſe words, but after ſome revolution of time plainly perceived it: for the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> did not indeed quite throw of his <hi>Regular habit;</hi> but degenerating, and abandoning all piety, ſpent his dayes wandring, becoming the <hi>burden</hi> of the earth, and a <hi>Scandall</hi> to all.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it was ſo known abroad that <hi>Philip</hi> excelled in the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Diſcerning,</hi> that <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII deſirous to prove a certain Virgin named <hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>He went another time to <hi>S.

Would</hi> I <hi>did not,</hi> replied ſhe; immediately falling into a <hi>ſwoon,</hi> was perfectly quiet of all annoyance from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. But <hi>Philip,</hi> ſeeing the people coming in apace to him, inſtantly skipped a way, thereby to decline all popular applauſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the <hi>Devils,</hi> that if the <hi>poſſeſt</hi> were by them hindred from the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> or receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he could ſo maſter them, that they ſhould no further retard them from ſuch holy Duties. Once a Women of the <hi>Capuchins Order</hi> came to the Church at <hi>Vallicella</hi> with ſome others, her Country-Woman; and as ſhe approached to participate of the <hi>B. Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:114712:143"/> her, that ſhe was not able to receive it, when it was reached forth to her. At which the <hi>B. Father,</hi> who from the Seat of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, comming nigher layed his hand on her head, and ſhe preſently received it without any difficulty.</p>
                        <p>There hapned another like example. <hi>Two</hi> poor old Women came one day to the <hi>Oratory,</hi> one of them aſking to ſpeak with <hi>Philip.</hi> The <hi>Sacriſt</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, He was old and feeble, and could not come down ſo low; <hi>Pray, call Him;</hi> ſaid ſhe again; <hi>for this woman my Companion is troubled with an evill Spirit: and I would fain have her make her</hi> Confeſſion <hi>to that Holy</hi> Prieſt. The <hi>Sacriſt</hi> again refuſed, ſhe redoubles her requeſts and reinforces her ſuit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, till at laſt ſhe prevailed with him to go, who relating, what had paſſed, to <hi>Philip;</hi> he bid, <hi>Turn her out; for what have I to do with them that are Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt?</hi> Yet afterwards pitying her, went down into the Church to her; the Woman, as ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw him, ſhook, and was unwilling to come nigh him, but as ſhe was brought by force; to whom the <hi>Father</hi> only ſaid in a ſtill Voice; <hi>Woman kneel:</hi> ſhe quietly kneeled down &amp; <hi>confeſſed</hi> her ſins. After that ſhe received the <hi>H. Communion</hi> of him: and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward came often to him, and devoutly received the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt moleſtation from the <hi>Devill.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the proud fiend, unable to bear this Vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage unto the <hi>H. man,</hi> bewrayed his rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him ſundry ways, whenſoever he was either commanded to come forth, or be ſilent. <hi>Joh. Anton. Luccius</hi> at <hi>Philips</hi> appointment had adjured one that was <hi>poſſeſt,</hi> and, in ſcorn to the foul ſpirit, ſcourged her ſharpely; which mockery ſo offended him, that he appears to <hi>Philip that</hi> night in a <hi>black</hi>
                           <pb n="263" facs="tcp:114712:143"/> and hideous ſhape, threatning to miſchiefe him; but, when he could not hurt him, went away enraged, filling his Chamber with moſt a ſtinking Vapour.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, the <hi>Wicked ſpirit</hi> could not abide, that, when <hi>Philip</hi> was ſent for, he ſhould <hi>depute</hi> another to the <hi>Exorciſme,</hi> counting himſelf much underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued thereby. Thereupon the <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſending a <hi>Priest</hi> one time to adjure a <hi>Maid</hi> that was <hi>poſſeſt,</hi> and he doing it accordingly; when the <hi>Prieſt</hi> came home, as he was knocking up a <hi>nail</hi> in the <hi>Wall,</hi> the Devill overturned the <hi>ſtool</hi> he ſtood upon with ſuch a force, as had like to have coſt him his life; and at the ſame inſtant ſpoke out of the mouth of the <hi>Maid,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I thought I had killed him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though <hi>God</hi> beſtowed on him this <hi>prerogative</hi> of <hi>diſpoſſeſſing Devills,</hi> yet he ſeldome, except upon neceſſity, would undertake that imployment, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many times thoſe who ſeemed <hi>poſſeſt</hi> by the <hi>Devill</hi> were not ſo indeed: adding, that theſe kind of <hi>fits</hi> proceeded oftimes from <hi>nature;</hi> as from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or diſtemper of the <hi>Brain,</hi> or ſuch like cauſes. And in <hi>Women</hi> frequently from infirmities <hi>peculiar</hi> to them, and ſometimes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, for certain reaſons and ends they purpoſe to themſelves.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>example,</hi> once he was ſent for to a <hi>Maid,</hi> that was thought to be poſſeſt by them that lived with her; for ſhe would run up and down a nights, and <hi>roar</hi> out, <hi>break</hi> the earthen Veſſels, and throw the <hi>houſhold-ſtuff</hi> about: He looking on her, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her not poſſeſt; but tranſported with ſtrong and corrupt affections, told her Brother: <hi>Would you have your Siſter cured of this diſeaſe? whenever ſhe is thus mad hereafter tame her with whipping.</hi> He
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:114712:144"/> did ſo, and ſhe ſoon left playing her <hi>pranks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another time a young Wench was in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner brought to him, who diſſembled: as ſoon as <hi>Philip</hi> ſaw her, he told her Parents; <hi>This Maid is not poſſeſt, but fains her ſelf ſo.</hi> And ſo it proved in the concluſion, for when ſhe was married ſhe left her counterfeiting.</p>
                        <p>It chanced much about the ſame time, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Woman named <hi>Sidera,</hi> whoſe friends thought her <hi>poſſeſt,</hi> was removed from <hi>Sabini</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> that by the viſiting thoſe Holy places, and by the <hi>Exorciſmes</hi> of Holy men ſhe might be regained from the Devils power. So her friends appointed to have her one day to <hi>S. Peters</hi> Church; that ſhe might be preſent at the <hi>Solemn Benediction</hi> of the <hi>Pope;</hi> but ſhe ſtealling away privately flung her ſelf head-long into a <hi>Well,</hi> whence the people of the houſe took her out, without any harm, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſafe to S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and back again. Many <hi>Prieſts</hi> had oft <hi>Exorciz'd,</hi> and torn her fleſh with ſcourgings, almoſt ſuffocating her with continuall ſomentations and perfumes, but nothing ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe was at laſt had to <hi>Philip,</hi> who looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and praying to God, ſaid; <hi>This woman is not poſſeſt, but Lunatique: therefore uſe her gently, and do not torture the poor wretch with Exorciſmes.</hi> They followed his directions, and conveyed her home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: who continued a kind of <hi>Ideot</hi> ever after, as long as ſhe lived, and though ſhe did not <hi>rave</hi> ſo much afterward, yet ſhe doted ſtill at certain times. Hereupon the <hi>Father adviſed</hi> his <hi>Sons,</hi> not to believe too haſtily that people were <hi>Poſſeſt,</hi> and that, except in extream neceſſity, they ſhould forbear <hi>Exorcizing,</hi> for many and great inconveniences that uſually enſue thereon.</p>

                        <p>IN the mean time <hi>Nerus de Nigris,</hi> one who always honoured and highly reſpected <hi>Philip,</hi> having a fair <hi>fortune,</hi> and no <hi>Iſſue Male,</hi> intended to have a Silver <hi>Coffin</hi> made to keep the <hi>Corps</hi> in. Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the <hi>Prieſts</hi> with his purpoſe, they judged it meet, to ſee firſt in what condition the <hi>Sacred Reliques</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> were. So, on the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>March, four years</hi> after his death, breaking down the <hi>Wall,</hi> and opening his <hi>Tomb,</hi> they found the <hi>Corps</hi> covered all over with Rubbiſh, his clothes ſo mouldred and conſumed, they looked more like a heap of <hi>dirt,</hi> then apparrell: yea the <hi>plate</hi> of <hi>braſs,</hi> wherein was contained a Memoriall of the <hi>B. man,</hi> had taken ruſt: and every thing that was but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fell in pieces ſtraight. Inſomuch as the <hi>Fathers</hi> thought all was vaniſhed into Duſt.</p>
                        <p>But when they had taken away all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, they diſovered the <hi>Body</hi> not only unconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the <hi>Breſt</hi> eſpecially ſo clear and whole, the skin ſo tender and ſoft, that they fell into extream admiration and joy together: the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently maintaining it to be done by <hi>Miracle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After all this, <hi>Abbot Creſcentius,</hi> oft heretofore mentioned, procures a <hi>Cipreſs Coffin</hi> to be made; into which, being decently provided, with a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Silk Counterpoint</hi> over it, taking the <hi>Body</hi> out of the old one, they laid it, about <hi>Evening</hi> on the <hi>thirteenth</hi> of <hi>March.</hi> All both <hi>Priests,</hi> and others of the <hi>Congregation</hi> came to do <hi>Reverence</hi> to the

                  <p>For, by the oft-redoubled commands of this our Father, did we adventure on ſo difficult a work; and however loth and unwilling, as diſtruſting our own ſtrengths, undertook it though, in obedience to the Divine Will, whereto he did ſo vehemently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, that if at any time, ſurcharged with the weight of ſo heavy a burden, we deſiſted from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

                     </head>
                     <p>WHy, <hi>ſay they,</hi> are not thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought now adays, which ye bragg of in former times? I might indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they were neceſſary before the World believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo it might believe. He that ſtill requires <hi>Miracles</hi> for his <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>Grand Miracle</hi> himſelf, for not believing when the World believes. But this they alleage, that it might be thought thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> were not then done. No? whence then is it, that <hi>Christs Aſcenſion</hi> into heaven in the fleſh is ſo publickly, and ſo religiouſly averred? Wherefore in thoſe learned Ages, which would at no hand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Impoſſibilities, did the World without any Miracles at all, too too miraculouſly believe things ſo incredible? Will they ſay, haply they were <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,</hi> and therefore <hi>credited?</hi> Why then do not they themſelves believe? Our Argument is briefly this. Either this incredible thing, which was not ſeen, was confirmed by other incredible things both done and ſeen; or being ſo credible, as needed no <hi>Miracles</hi> to enforce it, it condemns their groſs incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:114712:193"/> This I would reply, to ſilence ſuch ſhallow Perſons.</p>
                     <p>For, we cannot deny, but there have been many <hi>Miracles</hi> done, which atteſt that <hi>one</hi> ſignall, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Miracle,</hi> of <hi>Christs Aſcenſion</hi> into heaven in that fleſh wherein he a roſe again. Which are all written in the ſame <hi>Records</hi> unqueſtionable for their truth; both what was done, and in confirmation of what: being divulged for the propagating the <hi>Faith,</hi> and by the Faith propagated are ſo much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged. They are ſolemnly read, that they might be believed, yet ſhould not be read ſolemnly, but that they are believed. Yea even <hi>now</hi> are <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought in his Name, either by his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or by the <hi>Prayers,</hi> or <hi>Memorials</hi> of his <hi>Saints:</hi> which, being not commemorated in ſo publick a <hi>Regiſter,</hi> ſhine not altogether with ſo bright a fame. For, <hi>them</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> which was to be generally publiſhed, cauſeth to be read in every place, and imprints in the memories of all: whereas theſe are hardly known to the City where they are done, or to any the adjoining Quarters. And commonly they are few, that know thereof, and many that do not, eſpecially if it be a large City; and oftimes, when they are related to others, the Authority, that recommends them, is not ſuch, as that they ſhould be believed without ſcruple or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr, although they be conveyed from one beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Miracle</hi> done at <hi>Millain,</hi> while we were there, what time one blind received his ſight, might be taken notice of by divers: both for that it is a vaſt City, and the <hi>Emperour</hi> at that time being, there, the matter was tranſacted in the eye of a numerous multitude, which flocked unto the <hi>Bodyes</hi>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:114712:193"/> of the <hi>Martyrs Protaſius</hi> and <hi>Gervaſius.</hi> Which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concealed and unknown to any, were in a dream diſcovered to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and found; in which place the <hi>blind</hi> man, freed from his former darkneſs, beheld the light of day. But who except a very few, knew of the Cure done at <hi>Carthage</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Innocentius, Advocate</hi> to the <hi>Deputy Governour,</hi> at which I was preſent, and ſaw it with mine Eyes? For, being himſelf very Religious, as likewiſe his whole <hi>houſe,</hi> he had entertained me, and my Brother <hi>Alipius,</hi> coming from beyond ſea, not yet <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but <hi>Lay-Chriſtians,</hi> and at that time we dwelt with him. He was under the <hi>Surgeons</hi> hands for certain <hi>Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's,</hi> of which he had many, and very painfull to him, ariſing in his hinder parts, about the bottom of the <hi>Trunk.</hi> They had newly lanced him, and tried other experiments of their Art upon him: who endured both continuall, and horrid tortures in the Cutting. And yet one <hi>Cavity,</hi> among ſo many, which ſhould have been lanced, eſcaped them, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo undiſcovered that they never touched it at all: and, all the reſt that had been ſearched being healed up, that one remaining only defeated their pains. He, jealous of their delays, and very much dreading a <hi>ſecond</hi> inciſion (as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> that lived in his houſe had told him beforehand, whom they would not ſuffer ſo much as to ſee how he was cut, when they did it; and himſelf in a rage had thruſt out of doors, and with much ado admitted again) burſt out into theſe words: <hi>Will ye cut me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? muſt I come to his ſaying, whom ye would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be by?</hi> They ſcoffed at that <hi>Phyſician</hi> as a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> allaying his fears with fair words and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Thus ſeverall dayes paſſed, but all they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed him nothing: the <hi>Surgeons</hi> ſtill perſiſt in their
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:114712:194"/> promiſes, that they would perfect that Cure by <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> not by <hi>Inciſion.</hi> They called in likewiſe to their aſſiſtance one <hi>Ammonius,</hi> then living, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and eminent <hi>Surgeon,</hi> who, having viewed the place, warranted, what they out of their practice and experience had affirmed. Hereupon confident, upon his aſſurance, as though he were out of danger, he jeered the <hi>Phyſician</hi> that lived with him, for ſaying he muſt be lanced anew. In ſhort, after they had trifled away divers days to no purpoſe, they were fain, wearied and aſhamed, to confeſs, it was not poſſible to cure him, but by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi> Strook with the extream horrour hereof, he trembled and grew pale, but recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he was able to ſpeak, he bid them be gone, and come no more at him: when, drowned in tears, and fettered in an inſuperable neceſſity, he could think of no courſe, but to ſend for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> who was at that time reputed for an excellent <hi>Surgeon,</hi> to do, what for meer anger he would not ſuffer <hi>them</hi> to go about. He, when he was come, and <hi>Artiſt-like</hi> had by the remaining <hi>skars</hi> obſerved their endeavours, doing the part of an honeſt man, adviſed him, to let thoſe have the credit of that Cure, who had been at ſo much trouble already about it, as he both ſaw, and wondred at: adding, that unleſs he were cut, it was utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ever to heale him: that it was exceedingly contrary to his nature, to defraud them of the glory of ſo great labour, for a ſmall matter that was behind, whoſe skilfull pains, induſtry, attendance he ſaw even to admiration in his very skars. Then by his appointment they were fetched again, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to have the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> by, when they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that <hi>head,</hi> which in the judgment of all was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:114712:194"/> thought incurable. Which buſineſs was deferred to the next day. No ſooner were they gone, but there aroſe ſuch a dolefull lamentation throughout the Houſe, out of immoderate grief for their <hi>Master,</hi> that, as though they had mourned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his <hi>Herſe,</hi> we could hardly pacify it. Holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons daily reſorted to him, the then <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>

Then we went in to Prayer, where we, as the manner is, kneeling down upon the ground, he with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch violence threw himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all along, as if one had flung him down, and began to pray after ſuch a ſort, with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, ſuch fervour of ſpirit, ſuch a flood of tears, ſuch groans, and ſobbings, ſhaking every joynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and even ſtopping his breath again, as what man living is able to expreſs?

                     <p>A certain <hi>Votreſs</hi> at a Neighbouring <hi>Town</hi> called <hi>Caſpiliana,</hi> being extream ill paſt all hope, her <hi>Coat</hi> was brought to the ſame <hi>Tombe;</hi> but before it came back again, ſhe <hi>dyed.</hi> Yet her <hi>Parents</hi> wrapping her <hi>Corps</hi> up in it, her Spirit returned, and ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Hippo</hi> one <hi>Baſſus</hi> a <hi>Syrian</hi> prayed at the ſame <hi>Martyrs</hi> Monument for a ſick Daughter of his, that was like to dy, having taken her <hi>Garment</hi> to the place with him; when on the ſudden there came Servants from home to tell him, ſhe was dead. But while he was at his Prayers, his friends meeting with them forbad them to acquaint him therewith, that he might not go mourning along the Streets. So returning home to his houſe, which rang with the lamentations of his <hi>Servants,</hi> he threw her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he had carried with him, upon her, and ſhe came to life again.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame <hi>Hippo</hi> likewiſe, the <hi>Son</hi> of one <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> a <hi>Banker</hi> fell ſick and died. And as the <hi>Coorſe</hi> was laid out, and proviſion made for the <hi>funerall</hi>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:114712:199"/> one of his friends, while ſome were wailing and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, others adminiſtring words of comfort, hinted unto them, that they ſhould anoint the <hi>Corps</hi> with the <hi>Oile</hi> of the <hi>B. Martyr.</hi> Which was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er done but he was reſtored to life,</p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>Eleuſinus,</hi> one that had been <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune,</hi> laid his <hi>Son,</hi> a little Infant newly <hi>dead,</hi> upon the <hi>Martyrs Memoriall,</hi> that is in his <hi>Mannour</hi> in our <hi>Suburbs,</hi> and, after his Prayers powred forth with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Tears in the place, took him up <hi>alive.</hi> What ſhall I do? My promiſe of compleating this work haſtens me, ſo that I cannot <hi>name</hi> all thoſe I know: and queſtionleſs moſt of my familiars, when they read theſe, will take it ill, that I have omitted ſo many, which they certainly know as well as I. Whoſe pardon at preſent I muſt crave, and that they would conſider, how laborious an enterprize it is, to perform that, which the diſpatch of this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment undertaken permits me not here to do. For ſhould I only <hi>write</hi> down the <hi>Miraculous Cures,</hi> to let paſs other things which have been done within the Confines of <hi>Calama</hi> and <hi>Hippo</hi> by this <hi>Martyr,</hi> I mean the <hi>Moſt Glorious Steven,</hi> I might compile many Volumes; yet not comprize them all; but only thoſe, whereof <hi>Testimonials</hi> are brought in, that ſo they may be divulged to the people. For ſo we have ordered; being deſirous that we having ſeen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in theſe our days inſtances of a Divine &amp; Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power frequently ſhewen like thoſe of old, they ſhould not be buried in oblivion, or kept from publick view.</p>
                     <p>It is ſcarce <hi>two years</hi> ſince the <hi>Monument</hi> at <hi>Hippo-Regius</hi> was erected, when as the <hi>Books</hi> delivered in to us concerning theſe prodigious effects, (yet many other as we are moſt certain not being given in,) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

For, when we were there awhile ſince, we deſired <hi>Petronia</hi> a <hi>Noble Lady,</hi> that had been miraculouſly recovered of a long and dangerous ſickneſs, when all aid of the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> failed her, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>place</hi> likewiſe wiſhing the ſame, to give in a <hi>Declaration</hi> to be read in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> who moſt willingly aſſented, and did ſo. In which one thing was inſerted, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here conceale, though hurried away to other matters importing this preſent deſign.</p>
                     <p>She relates, how a certain <hi>Jew</hi> adviſed her to ſow into a <hi>girdle</hi> of hair a <hi>Ring</hi> that had a <hi>ſtone</hi> ſet in it found in the <hi>reins</hi> of an Oxe, and to gird her ſelf with it under her clothes next her skin; furniſhed with this remedy ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to the <hi>Shrine</hi> of the <hi>Holy Martyr.</hi> And in her Travaills from <hi>Carthage,</hi> after having ſtayed at a <hi>Mannour</hi> ſhe had in thoſe parts ſeated upon the <hi>River Bagrada,</hi> as ſhe roſe up to go on her journey, ſhe eſpied the <hi>Ring</hi> lying at her feet, and wondring at it felt for the <hi>girdle</hi> of <hi>hair</hi> in which it was bound, which when ſhe found faſt with all its knots, as it had been tied, ſhe gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:114712:200"/> the <hi>Ring</hi> had broke, and ſo ſtipped out, but then finding it whole, ſhe interpeted it as a <hi>preſage</hi> of her future recovery, intimated by ſo ſtrange a Portent and untying her <hi>girdle</hi> threw both <hi>it</hi> and the <hi>Ring</hi> into the <hi>River.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This they <hi>believe</hi> not, who do not believe that the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was born of his <hi>Mother,</hi> her virginall encloſure remaining entire, and that he went in to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> the <hi>doors</hi> being <hi>ſhut.</hi> But let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into this, and as they find it true, let them believe thoſe other. She is an <hi>Honourable Lady,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſcended, nobly matched, dwelling at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage:</hi> both the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>perſon</hi> ſo illuſtrious cannot lye concealed from ſuch as make enquiry. Nay the very <hi>Martyr</hi> at whoſe intreaty ſhe was reſtored, did believe in the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Perpetuall Virgin,</hi> in <hi>him</hi> that entred in to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> the <hi>doors</hi> being <hi>ſhut</hi> did he believe: laſtly, for which end all this is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by us, in him who aſcended into <hi>heaven</hi> in the <hi>fleſh</hi> wherein he roſe, did he believe: and therefore were ſuch ſtrange things effected by him, becauſe for this <hi>Faith</hi> he laid down his life.</p>
                     <p>So that even <hi>now</hi> adays <hi>Miracles</hi> are wrought: the ſame <hi>God</hi> working them by whom &amp; how he pleaſes, who did thoſe we read of: but neither are they ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally remarked, nor are they ſo <hi>riveted</hi> into the memory by often reading and repeating them, as not at all to be forgot. For evenwhere that care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which we have have begun of late, to read the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of ſuch as have found benefit, unto the Aſſembly, yet they that are preſent hear it but once, and they are not many, ſo that neither ſuch as were by within a few days remember what they heard, &amp; ſcarce any one of them can be found, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what which himſelf heard to another, whom he knows was not there.</p>

Of theſe <hi>two,</hi> a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter, <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Palladia</hi> came to us, by this time known to moſt places through their ſad and ſore calamity. Hither they came ſome <hi>fifteen days</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> reſorting dayly to Church, and to the <hi>Memoriall</hi> of the <hi>Glorious S.

When lo! he roſe up, and without the leaſt ſhaking, for he was recovered, ſtood looking on the lookers on. What one of all the Spectators could hereupon forbear giving praiſe to <hi>God?</hi> the whole Church rang again with <hi>ſhouts</hi> of acclamation and <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> Then they came running to me where I was ſitting ready to come forth: they flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo faſt one upon another, that each laſt man told for news, that which his fellow had related be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. While I was rejoycing, and giving thanks to <hi>God</hi> in my heart, in comes he himſelf, with a many more, falling down at my feet, whom I took up and kiſſed. So forth we go to the people, with whom the Church was thronged, reſounding with Peales of joy, none ſilent, but all unanimouſly cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>God be thanked, God be praiſed.</hi> I ſalute them and thereupon they ſhouted louder than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the ſame expreſſions.

The man dined with me, and punctually related to me the whole ſtory of his own, his Mothers, and Brothers heavy affliction. Next day after Sermon I promiſed to recite the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a <hi>Summary</hi> of that Relation to the people.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:114712:201"/> Which I performed <hi>three</hi> days after Eaſter, cauſing both the <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Siſter</hi> to ſtand on the ſteps of the <hi>Quire,</hi> whilſt the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>Meanwhile, having read the Narration, I bad them go from the view of the people, and began to examine more diligently the cauſe of ſuch effect; when behold! as I was debating it, more ſhoutings of new gratulation were heard from the <hi>Monument</hi> of the <hi>Martyr.</hi> They that liſtened to me turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout began to gather thither-ward: for the Maid, when ſhe went down the ſteps, betook her thither to pray to the <hi>Holy Martyr;</hi> and no ſooner had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Bars,</hi> but falling along, as though ſhe had been aſleep, roſe up <hi>well.</hi> Then, as we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what the matter was, that they made ſuch joyous outcries, they accompanying her into the <hi>Chancell,</hi> where we were, bring her cured from the <hi>Martyrs Sepulchre.</hi>

For, in the Lord are their ſoules praiſed. Let us therefore credit them, both ſpeaking truth, and working wonders. And, of that Truth this is the main, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> roſe from the dead; and ſhewed the immortality of the Reſurrection, in his own fleſh firſt; of which he promiſed, either in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the new world, or in the end of this, to make us partakers.</p>

                     <p>HEnce alſo is that Queſtion ſolved; After what manner the Martyrs, by the favours granted to ſuch as pray, declare, that they intermeddle in humane affairs, if the dead know not what the living do? For, we have heard it, not by uncertain rumours, but undoubted witneſſes, that, when <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> was beſieged by the Barbarians, the <hi>Bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor Felix,</hi> not only by certain inſtances of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:114712:209"/> favours, but even in the plain view of men, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divers citizens and inhabitants, whom he eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally loved. But theſe things were divine manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, differing far from the uſuall courſe aſſigned to the ſeverall ſorts of creatures. For, becauſe, when our Lord was pleaſed, water was preſently turned into wine, it follows not, that therefore we ſhould not diſtinguiſh, what vertue water in the proper order of Elements hath, from what in the rarity, or rather ſingularity, of that divine operation upon it. Nor, becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> roſe again, therefore doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very dead man riſe again at pleaſure; or therefore are the lifeleſs rouſed up by the living, as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep is by another that is waking. Therefore the bounds of humane things are of one ſort, the effects of the divine power of another: what is done <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> is one thing, what <hi>miraculouſly</hi> another: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, both God is aſſiſtant to nature, that ſhe may be, and likewiſe nature not excluded to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles. We muſt not therefore imagine, that any of the dead promiſcuouſly can intermix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the affairs of thoſe alive, becauſe the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> are preſent at the curing or helping ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons: but, we are rather to conceive that, by the divine power it is, that the Martyrs do intermeddle in the affairs of the living; becauſe by their own proper nature the <hi>dead</hi> cannot do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Although this Queſtion tranſcend the reach of my underſtanding; <hi>How</hi> the <hi>Martyrs</hi> help thoſe, who certainly are helped by them; whether they are perſonally preſent at the ſame time, in ſo divers, and ſo far diſtant, places; either where their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are, or wherever, beſides at their Memorials, they are known to be preſent: or whether (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed from all commerce with men, into a

                     <p>ANd ſuch a one (tis probable) was <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> whom <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Elder being <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> conſulted about the event of the Civill war: for he had the gift of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> For I doubt not, but that, as every particular man may have each of thoſe gifts particularly, ſo might ſome one have many. This <hi>John,</hi> when a certain Woman, that was very devout, impatiently deſired to ſee him, and (he much relucting, becauſe to women he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no ſuch thing) much importuned him by her husband for ſuch a favour; <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tell your wife, ſhe ſhall ſee me at night, but in her ſleep:</hi> as it came to paſs. When he inſtructed her in all things fitting to a <hi>Believer</hi> in a married condition. She, when ſhe awaked, told her husband, that ſhe had ſeen ſuch a man of <hi>God,</hi> as he well knew him to be; and what ſhe had heard from him. This a grave and Noble Perſon, moſt worthy to be credited, and who had it from the parties themſelves, told me. But if I ſhould ever have ſeen that <hi>Holy Monk,</hi> ſince, as report goes of him, he was moſt patient in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions, and moſt prudent in anſwering them; I would have asked him what is pertinent to this Queſtion: Whether he himſelf came to that woman in her ſleep, that is, his ſpirit in the ſhape of his body, as we dream of our ſelves in the ſhape of our
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:114712:211"/> bodies; on, whether this viſion befell the woman in her ſleep (he being buſy about ſomething elſe, or in his ſleep dreaming of ſomething elſe) either by ſome <hi>Angel,</hi> or ſome other way; and whether he did foreknow, that what he foretold, would come to paſs, by the Spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi> revealing it to him. For, were he by her as ſhe was in her ſleep, it muſt be (doubtleſs) by wonderfull grace and priviledge, not nature; and by eſpeciall favour of <hi>God,</hi> not by any power of his own. But if ſhe ſaw him in her ſleep, he doing ſomething elſe, or being aſleep, and taken up with other viſions; then, ſome ſuch thing it was, as that we read of in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> Act. 9. where the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Ananias</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> and tels him, that <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw <hi>Ananias</hi> coming to him; whereas <hi>Ananias</hi> himſelf knew nothing of it. That man of <hi>God</hi> would inform me of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe particulars: of whom I would further enquire concerning the <hi>Martyrs;</hi> whether they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves, to ſuch as in their ſleep, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way behold them, in what ſhape ſoever they pleaſe: and eſpecially at ſuch times, when the Devils in the poſſeſſed do confeſs that they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by them, beſeeching them to ſpare them: or, whether by <hi>Gods</hi> appointment theſe things are done by the <hi>Angelicall</hi> powers in honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the <hi>Saints</hi> for the benefit of men, they themſelves remaining in perfect reſt, attending on other far better viſions apart from us, and praying for us. (For at <hi>Millain,</hi> at the Monument of the <hi>H.

                           <hi>Quidam Curma nomine</hi> &amp;c.—A certain man, by name <hi>Curma,</hi> a mean officer of the Corporation of <hi>Tullia,</hi> near to Hippo, ſcarce a <hi>Duum-vir</hi> of the place, and a plain ruſtick, falling fick and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his ſences, lay ſome days for dead: only ſome little breath was in his noſtrils, which with putting to ones hand was hardly perceived, and, being an argument of one yet alive, ſuffered him
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:114712:212"/> not to be buried. He moved not a joint, took no ſuſtenance, diſcerned nothing by his eyes, or any other ſenſe, howſoever tortured. Yet mean while he ſaw many things as we do in ſleep which (after many days as it were awaking) he related. And firſt as ſoon as he opened his eyes, <hi>let ſome body go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to Curma the Smiths houſe, and ſee what's there adoing.</hi> Whither when one went, he was found dead at the ſame inſtant that this man was reſtored to his ſenſes, and in a manner revived from death. Then he told them who were with him, obſerving him; that, the Smith was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preſented, when he was releaſed, and that he heard there, whence he returned, that, <hi>not Curma the Officer, but Curma the Smith, was commanded to be brought to thoſe places of the dead.</hi> in theſe viſions, as it were in dreams, he was alſo amongſt the dead, whom (according to the difference of their merits) he ſaw to be differently treated. he alſo knew ſome, [there] whom he had known alive. And haply I ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that theſe had been really the Dead whom he ſaw, had not he ſeen, in thoſe his (as I may call them) dreams, ſome, who at this day are yet alive, to wit, certain Clergy-men of his own country: from one of whom (a Prieſt) he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to go and be baptized by me at Hippo, which thing he ſaid alſo ſeemed to him to have been done. In that viſion therefore he ſaw the Preſbyter, Clergy, my ſelf, not yet dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſaw thoſe alſo dead. Why therefore may not he be thought to have ſeen them, as us; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both, abſent, and ignorant [the while]; and and ſo not themſelves, but their, as alſo the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's, ſimilitudes? For he ſaw the place alſo where
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:114712:212"/> the Prieſt with the Clergy was, and <hi>Hippo,</hi> where (as ſeemed) he was by me baptized. In which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he really was not, when as he ſeemed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be there. For he knew not what was done there at that time; which doubtleſs he would have known, had he been there indeed. Laſtly after divers things he ſaw, he related how he was brought into Paradiſe, and that it was ſaid to him, as he was releaſed to returne to his friends, <hi>Go, be baptized, if you will enter into this place of the Bleſſed.</hi> Then, being advertiſed that he ſhould bee baptized by me, he anſwered, that was already done. To whom he that ſpake with him replied, <hi>Go, be baptized indeed; for that you ſaw was but in a viſion.</hi> Afterwards he recovered, went to Hippo: and Eaſter now nigh, gave in his name among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Competentes, alike unknown to me, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; nor did he regard to diſcover this viſion, either to me, or to any of our Clergy. He was baptized, &amp; the holy-days ended, he returned home. And two years after or more, I came to know all this, Firſt by a friend of his and mine at my table, diſcourſing of ſome ſuch things. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I procured that himſelf in perſon ſhould relate this to me: his own towns-men, men of credit atteſting, both concerning his ſtrange ſickneſs, how he lay for dead many days together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that other <hi>Curma,</hi> the Smith above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; as alſo concerning all thoſe other things, he told to me, which they remembred &amp; averred they had then heard from him. Wherefore, as he ſaw his own Baptiſme, and my ſelf, and <hi>Hippo,</hi> and the Church, and <hi>Font,</hi> not in the things themſelves, but in certain Similitudes thereof; and ſome others then living, the living themſelves not knowing it.

                  <p>AS, of all outward things there is nothing that ſo much awakens our faith, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens our hope, as Miracles; which render viſible to us (as it were) the imviſible preſence of God; So all devout perſons, that have heard of the marveils, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath of late done in the Church of <hi>Port-Royall</hi> by a holy thorne of his <hi>Crown,</hi> have thereby received a ſenſible conſolation, and thought themſelves obliged to bleſs his name for thoſe extraordinary marks of his gracious goodneſs. Whoſe bleſſed name and power that it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorified by many more, to whom perhaps as yet no exact relations of theſe late wonderfull acts of Gods Mercy hath hitherto arrived, I have thought good to give the Reader a particular account not of all of them, but ſome more remarkable; as they have been atteſted b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> many witneſſes, and more manifeſtly provedby reaſon of the Oppoſition, which ſome religious Perſons, not ſo well affected toward the Votaries of that <hi>Monastery,</hi> made at firſt to the truth thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:114712:215"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Monſieur de la Poterie,</hi> an Eccleſiaſticall Perſon of eminent quality and piety, having enjoyed for ſome time, amongſt the other reliques of his chappell, a ſacred thorne of the <hi>Crowne</hi> of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> upon ſome importunity ſent it to the <hi>Carmelite Nuns,</hi> who had a holy curioſity to ſee it; and afterwards upon Friday <hi>March</hi> 24. 1646. ſent it alſo to thoſe of <hi>Port-Royall:</hi> where the Religious women received it with very much devotion; and placed it in their quire upon a Table dreſſed up in form of an Altar; and after they had ſung the <hi>Antheme</hi> of the <hi>Holy Crowne,</hi> all went and kiſſed it. A young maid (a Penſioner in the <hi>Monastery</hi>) by name <hi>Margaret Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> who for the ſpace of <hi>three</hi> years and an halfe had had a <hi>fiſtula lachrimalis</hi> in her eye, came alſo in her order to kiſs it. And the Religious Woman her Miſtreſs, being now more then ever affrighted at the ſwelling and deformity of her <hi>ulcerous</hi> eye, was inwardly moved to touch the ſore with the Relique; believing that God was ſufficiently both able and mercifull to heal her, and for the preſent ſhe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no more: But the little girle being retired to her chamber, after a quarter of an hour perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that her diſeaſe was cured; and havaing told it to her companions, it was found indeed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more appeared. There was no more tumour; her eye, which the ſwelling (having laſted three years) had waſted, and made continually to water, become as dry, as ſound, as lively as the other; the ſpring of that filthy matter, which every quarter of an hovr run down by the eye, the noſe, the mouth, and immediately before the miracle, had fallen upon her cheek (as ſhe declared in her depoſition) was wholly dryed up; the bone, which had been rotten and putrified, was reſtored to its firſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:114712:215"/> all the ſtench, which proceeded from it, and was ſo inſupportable, that by order of the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi> ſhe was ſeparated from Company, was changed into a breath as ſweet as an Infants; her ſmelling, entirely loſt by this filthy corruption falling through her noſe; was in the ſame inſtant reſtored; And all the other evill <hi>Symptoms</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereupon quite diſappeared; inſomuch that even her complexion, before pale and fallow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as clear and ſprightly as ever it had been.</p>
                  <p>What perſon of piety could have found fault, had this miracle cauſed ſuch applauſes, acclamations, and tranſports of ſpirituall joy as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> deſcribes, reporting the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Civ.

                  <p>But that which is moſt remarkable, is, that <hi>Mother Prioreſſe,</hi> to whom the Relique had been addreſſed, gave no notice of this matter for a whole week to that <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> her Kinſman, that had ſent it her. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed after <hi>eight</hi> dayes ſhe thought the reſpect ſhe owed him obliged her to give him account of it by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:114712:216"/> letter: the <hi>praeciſe</hi> words where of I think fit rather to inſert here, for that <hi>Monſieur de la Poterie</hi> ſending the ſame Relique a little after to the Religious <hi>Vrſelines,</hi> ſent withall the Originall of this letter, entreating them to read it, before they honoured that holy thorne; for that the miracle, which they ſhould finde atteſted therein, would make them have it ingreater Veneration.</p>
                  <p>Couſin,</p>
                  <p>I <hi>could not hitherto give you thanks for the good opinion you had of us, in favouring us, with the ſight of your holy relique. It ſeems to have bene ſent by an inſpiration from God; who would work by it a wonderfull effect, of which I think my ſelf obliged to informe you, although we purpoſed not to diſcover it to any perſon.</hi> Then ſhe gives him a brief relation of the miracle, which <hi>Monſieur Dalencé</hi> a famous <hi>Surgeon,</hi> came alſo to make to him the ſame day; and ſhe ends with theſe words. <hi>See Sr. a certain atteſtation of your relique, wherewith it hath pleaſed God to comfort us; and I take it for a praeſage, that he will heale our Souls, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them by the thornes of perſecution wherwith we are threatned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By thoſe ſo modeſt lines it may be conceived with what diſpoſition this grace was received at <hi>Port-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall perſon himſelf approves this modeſty, in his anſwer, returned, Ap. 2. the words whereof are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Reverend Mother and Couſin,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THe Reading of the letter, which you ſo affectionately writ to me, hath given me ſo great conſolation, that joy drew tears from both my heart and eyes. I cannot but commend the humble reſervedneſs you have,</hi>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:114712:216"/> 
                     <hi>not to publiſh the miracle, becauſe it is come to paſs in your Monaſtery; to which many, by reaſon of the malice of the times, have ſuch an averſion; that they will not believe, but that you have divulged it to procure a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reputation to your houſe, or for ſome other intereſts, which theſe men frame to themſelves according to their own humor and fancy. But for my part, I conceive my ſelf obliged to make it known, diſcreetly, upon occaſion; leſt I ſhould do contrary to what the Angel in Tobit teacheth us: It is good to keep</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tob. 12. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>cloſe the ſecret of a King, but it is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to reveale the works of God. And by ſo doing, it may be, that thoſe who hear of ſo apparent a miracle in your houſe, not without a particular opperation of divine providence, will abate the averſion they bear to it, and take compaſſion of the perſecution you ſuffer without cauſe. I doubt not, but our Lord will ſanctify your Souls by theſe perſecutions, and</hi> I <hi>beſeech him from the bottom of my heart that he will be pleaſed to ſtrengthen you to ſupport them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Port-Royall</hi> hath not been by any remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance or writing the firſt publiſher of this ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and aſtoniſhing a miracle. The firſt report of it came not from the Religious women; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that they ought to admire this mighty work of God in private, and in ſilence, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves <hi>fifteen</hi> years ago on a like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as God inſpired into his ſervants the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of hiding from the eyes of men the graces they receive from him; ſo doth he often make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more gloriouſly by other means. As on this occaſion he would that this miracle ſhould be known to all <hi>Paris,</hi> and believed of all the Court, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Religious women contributed nothing to the publiſhing of it.</p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:114712:217"/>
                  <p> The <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi> being touched with ſo great a wonder held themſelves bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to tell it to all the world; that glory might be given to him, who had let them ſee ſo adorable a touch of his Almighty hand upon the wholly disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured eye and face of that little girle. So did alſo <hi>Monſieur Perier,</hi> her father, a Counſellour of the Court of <hi>Aydes</hi> at <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Auvergne;</hi> from whence he had been ſent for (by a letter writ <hi>March</hi> 24. four hours before the miracle happened) to come and aſſiſt at the application of a cautery to the eye of his Daughter, which <hi>Monſieur Dalencé</hi> was to make aſſoon as he ſhould be arrived. And he was ſo ſurprized to finde her perfectly and miraculouſly cured, when he ſaw her at <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> Ap. 5. that he thought himſelf obliged in gratitude to God, to call together the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons,</hi> who all gave their atteſtation to it in writing upon <hi>good fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> Then did he joyne his voice with theirs, and imitated the zeal of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 44, 45.</note> him in the Goſpell, who publiſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where the favours he had received from <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> not withſtanding that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, not all the certainty of ſo wonderfull a work, nor all the aedification that it cauſed in the Church, could hinder ſome perſons in the Church it ſelf from diſſembling that they were ſcandalized at it. That which the <hi>Hereticks</hi> could not do without openly diſcovering their an imoſity againſt the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath been done by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi> For <hi>five</hi> moneths ſpace have they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deface the truth of this miracle out of the mindes of the people by the many falſe reports they have every where divulged.</p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:114712:217"/>
                  <p> Firſt they ſaid, it was a cheating and ſuppoſititious buſineſs, and that the eldeſt Siſter of the ſick girle was ſhewed inſtead of the other; which cauſed both the Siſters to be ſhewed together to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the <hi>Promoter,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>Afterward they gave out that her maladie was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and that ſhe was more afflicted with it then ever: this cauſed <hi>Monſieur Dalencé,</hi> who had ſeen her both ſick and well to come to <hi>Port-Royall</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to a <hi>Prince</hi> of the blood, to convince him of the falſeneſe of this report; as he was by his own eyes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly they ſaid, that the ulcer of the eye was indeed perfectly cured, but that the maligne humor which cauſed it, was fallen down upon the Nobler parts; and had brought the Patient to the laſt gaſp. Which report obliged <hi>Monſieur Guillard</hi> the <hi>Surgeon,</hi> who had ſeen her both ſick and healed, and had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the miracle under his hand, to come to ſee her in <hi>July</hi> 1656, where he found her as ſound and well as ſhe was the very firſt day. And afterward <hi>Monſieur Helix</hi> chief <hi>Surgeon</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> that had ſeen her in <hi>Aprill,</hi> returned <hi>Auguſt eighth,</hi> and having found her cure as perfect and admirable as it ſeemed to him the time before, declared under his hand; <hi>That he was bound to confeſs that God alone had the power to produce an effect ſo ſudden and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> Beſides; this miracle was witneſſed by the ſolemn atteſtation of publick perſons ſuch are the <hi>Phiſicians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi> who had given it under their hands; and by the juridicall depoſitions of <hi>twenty five,</hi> all unblamable witneſſes; which <hi>Monſiegnour</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toul</hi> drew up at the requeſt of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the <hi>Promoter;</hi> in which he laboured (as himſelf teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) with an extraordinary care; and which he

He ordained alſo that the Friday following a ſolemn <hi>Maſs</hi> of thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be ſaid in the <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of <hi>Port-Royall:</hi> (the which himſelf in perſon celebrated) and that this <hi>Miracle</hi> ſhould be publiſhed throughout <hi>Paris;</hi> and the reſt of the Dioeceſe, that all the people might glorify <hi>God</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>After this firſt miracle wrought at <hi>Port-Royall;</hi> this Sacred Relique was returned to its ancient owner, <hi>Monſieur de lâ Poterie;</hi> who kept it in his Chappell many dayes, and many perſons upon it reſorted thither to ſeek ſome relief of their ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and infirmityes. But it pleaſed God to work no miracle thereby in his houſe (as neither all the while it had been in many other places, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly amongſt thoſe Religious women, ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for their piety, the <hi>Carmelites</hi> and <hi>

                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:114712:218"/> who by their reputation could have added more ſplendour to ſuch miracles; and have made them been received with the applauſe of all the World. But he would not do any there, perhaps becauſe they having no enemies that perſecuted and defamed them, had no need (as ſome of themſelves ſaid) that he ſhould worke a miracle to teſtify that God was amongſt them, ſeeing there was none that made queſtion of it). Whereupon this Servant of God <hi>Monſieur de la Poterie</hi> ſeeing himſelf oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the great number of thoſe that came to his houſe, and troubled his retirement and reſt, thought, that ſeeing God had wrought no miracle by that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>thorne,</hi> ſave only at <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> that there it was, where he was pleaſed it ſhould remain. This only motive of faith and piety made him reſolve to ſend it thither again.</p>
                  <p>The relique was no ſooner returned to <hi>Port-Royall</hi> but God began to work by it new miracles. This holy <hi>Ark</hi> of the Covenant brought proſperity and bleſſing into that houſe, becauſe God would have it ſo, as at another time <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 12.</note> the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Covenant brought them into the houſe of a pious <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> I will recite here ſome of theſe miracles.</p>

I made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the communion at the beginning of her nine days, and yesterday again immediately after your departure. She hath by the ſpace of eight dayes been extraordinary ill. This morning, as I ſaid Maſs, ſhe ſuffered very great and greivous torment, ſhe applyed to her head the image, the little linnen, and the prayer, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it her pains were doubled; upon this ſhe had a thought that God would heale her; and for joy going to lift up her mind to God, ſhe raiſed her ſelf upon her feet, and walked all alone to the dore of the Infirmary, purpoſing to goe and worſhip our Lord in the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the Church: but beeing at the dore of her chamber, where ſhe was all alone, ſhe was again ſet in her chair, not knowing by what means. This happened three times, and every time was ſhe carried back into her chair. She called to mind that ſhe had not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave to goe out of the Infirmary: wherefore ſhe ſent to call Mother Superioreſſe and me. At my coming from the alter I went in, and found the poor maid in her chair all overcome with joy, ſhe told me what had happened and that ſhe hoped to go before the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We all together worſhipped Jeſus Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſaid the prayer of the holy thorne, and read in French the paſſion of our Lord according to S. John: in which time ſhe felt most greivous pains, which forced her to ſtretch her ſelf all along upon the ground: where we ſaw great agitations firſt in her stomack, next in her belly, which is wholly abated, and no ſwelling to be ſeen then in her armes and legs; all her ſhrunck ſinews ſtretching themſelves out at length. And aſſoon as the paſſion was wholly read, her pains ceaſed. As we aſſayed to lift her up into her chair, ſhe told me ſhe could eaſily raiſe her ſelf from the Ground, where ſhe lay all along, which ſhe did; and ſtanding up, ſaid that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:114712:224"/> to ſuffer her to go to the Church to worſhip our Lord. Thither ſhe went, walking with incredible ſpeed; without any pain, upon her bare feet (You know that no body durſt touch them, and that ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſhooes or ſtockins) and this in the ſight, and to the amazment of more then twelve of the Siſters, the reſt being together before the Holy Sacrament. She continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her knees more then half an hour, with a devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fervour able to kindle the like in the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. I made notice to be given to all the community, who were aſtoniſhed at ſo prodigious a miracle. And we all together begun a ſecond nine-dayes-prayer to beg of God a perfect accompliſhment. We brought her back walking on her feet into the infirmary where inſte ad of her chair, we cauſed her to ly down in bed; You know it is now more then three years, that ſhe could not ly down. I have been ſince dinner to confeſs her in bed, and ſhe telleth me, the ſwelling in her legs beginneth to fall.

Of <hi>Mad. de Mouchery</hi> dwelling near St. <hi>James's</hi> of the <hi>Hoſpitall;</hi> of a <hi>Maid</hi> about <hi>twenty four</hi> years old named <hi>Mary Elizabeth Renard,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. <hi>Renard</hi> of St. <hi>Laurences pariſh:</hi> of a tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours boy called <hi>Claudius le Roy:</hi> of a litle child <hi>two</hi> years and <hi>nine</hi> moneths old by name <hi>Claudia Beche</hi> daughter of Mr. <hi>Nicolas Beche</hi> in St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> ſtreet: and of many others, whoſe names are not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, who come every day to <hi>Port-Royall</hi> to render thanks to God for the favours that they have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>It is ſufficient to ſay, that, if God did not cauſe his aſſiſtance thereto be either perceived or hoped for, there is no humane conſideration that could draw ſo many perſons from the other end of the city to come to honour this holy thorne in the Church of <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> and to make their prayers there every Friday; for no man enticeth or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth them, by any means, nor doth any one ſeek or propoſe any other end but the glory of God, in this affair, which is wholly of God. And thisiis it which hath moved <hi>Monſieur de la Poterie</hi> freely to give that which before he had onely depoſited: ſo many extraordinary cures making him conceive that God would have him deprive himſelf of that treaſure of Bleſſings and graces, notwithſtanding the devotion he had to reverence it in his own Chappell amongſt the many other holy Reliques, and to give it as he hath done, to the Monaſtery of <hi>Port Royall:</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt by the wonders he daily worketh, makes it apparent, that there it is that he would have that holy <hi>thorne</hi> of his Crown to be honoured.</p>

                        <hi>REferam ad huc unum miraculum, in patriâ noſtrâ paucis abhinc annis, &amp;c.</hi> I will relate one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle more done in my own Countrey, to the great wonder of the neighbouring inhabitants, but a few years ago, to wit about the year 1640. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the buſineſs was told the <hi>King</hi> when at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which he commanded to be further examined: And it was this. A certain Boy of twelve years Old called <hi>John Trelille</hi> in the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> not far from the lands end, as they were playing at foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball after the manner of that country, ſnatching up the ball ran away with it, whereupon a girle in anger ſtrook him with a ſticke on the back bone; and ſo bruiſed or brake it, that for 16. years after he was forced to go creeping on the ground. In this Condition arrived to the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year of his age, he dreamt, that if he did but waſh in <hi>S. Maderns</hi> well, or in the ſtream running from it, he ſhould recover his former ſtrength and perfection. This is a place in <hi>Cornwall</hi> from the remains of antient devotion, frequented ſtill by Proteſtants on the <hi>Thurſdays</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> and eſpecially on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> of <hi>Corpus Chriſti;</hi> near to which well is a Chappell dedicated to S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,</hi> where is yet an Altar, and right againſt it a graſſy hillock (by the Country people every year made anew) which they call <hi>S. Maderns bed.</hi> The Chappell-roof is quite decayed, but a kind of thorne of it ſelf ſhooting forth of the old walls, ſo extends its boughs, as that it (ſtrangely) covers the whole Chappell, and ſupplies as it were a roof to it. So, one <hi>Thurſday</hi> in May, aſſiſted by one <hi>Periman</hi> his neighbour, nouriſhing great hopes from his dreame, thither he crept, and lying before the Altar and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:114712:225"/> praying very fervently, that (as it was related to him in his dream) he might regain his health and the ſtrength of his limbs, he waſhed his whole body in the ſtream that flowed from the Well, and ran through the Chappell: after which, having ſlept about an hour and an halfe on <hi>S. Maderns Bed,</hi> through the extreamity of pain he felt in his Nerves and arteries he began to cry out; and his companion helping and lifting him up, he perceived his hamms and his joynts ſomewhat extended, and himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtronger, inſomuch as, partly with his feet, partly with his hands, he went much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected than before. And before next Thurſday he got two crutches, reſting on which he could make a ſhift to walk (which before he could not): and coming then to the Chappel, as formerly, after having bathed himſelf, he ſlept again on the ſame bed; and at laſt awakened, found himſelf much ſtronger and more upright; and ſo leaving one crutch in the Chappell, he went home with the other. The third <hi>Thurſday</hi> he returned to the Chappell, and bathed as before, ſlept; and, when awake, roſe up quite cured, yea grew ſo ſtrong, that he wrought day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour amongſt other hired ſervants, and four years after, liſted himſelf a Souldier in the <hi>Kings</hi> army, where he behaved himſelf with great ſtoutneſs both of mind and body. At length in 1644. he was ſlain at the ſiege of <hi>Lime</hi> in <hi>Dorſet-ſhire.</hi>

                     <p>What fiction can be here I ſee not: That he ſhould have a dream to ſuch a purpoſe: that the event, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to things diſcovered in his dreame, ſhould manifeſt the truth thereof: That on <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on <hi>Corpus-Christi-Thurſday (Thurſday</hi> with Catholicks being memorable for the Holy Euchariſt, as <hi>Friday</hi> is for the <hi>Paſſion</hi>) upon the ſuppliants
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:114712:226"/> prayers, his deſired health ſhould be conferred: That the water ſacred to this Saint, or (more likely) bleſſed by him, when yet living, ſhould have this healing vertue: We read indeed in the Goſpell of the water moved by the Angel, which upon it, cured thoſe that were brought and put therein: and from the ſame ſpeciall bleſſing of God doubtleſs, at <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns</hi> interceſſion, for the ſingular reverence he had to the myſtery of the Body of Chriſt, this holy well received that healing power. The whole procedure and order of the matter ſpeaks it a miracle; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that it is acknowledged for ſuch by the Proteſtant-inhabitants themſelves: from whom I received this generally famed Relation.</p>

                     <p>THe trade that we have with good Spirits is not now diſcerned by the eye but is like to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſpirituall: yet not ſo, but that even in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily occaſions we have many times inſenſible helps from them, in ſuch manner, as that by the effects we can boldly ſay: here hath been an Angel, though we ſee him not. Of this kind was that (no leſs than miraculous) cure which at <hi>S. Maderns</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> was wrought upon a poor creeple, <hi>John Trelille;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (beſides the atteſtation of many hundreds of the neighbours) I took a ſtrict and perſonall examination in that laſt viſitation, which I either did, or ever ſhall hold. This man, that for 16. years together was faine to walk upon his hands, by reaſon of the cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the ſinews of his legs, (upon three moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his dream to waſh in that Well) was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo reſtored to his limbs, that I ſaw him able to walk &amp; get his own maintenance. I found, here was neither art, not colluſion; the thing done, the author inviſible.</p>
